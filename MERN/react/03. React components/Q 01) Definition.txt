## 3. React Components: Function vs Class Components

In React, components are reusable building blocks of the UI.
Historically, React had two ways to define components:

 Class Components (older approach)
 Function Components (modern, preferred approach)

Today, function components dominate, but understanding both is important.

---

## 1. What is a Class Component?

A class component is an ES6 class that extends React’s base component class.

### Key characteristics

 Uses classes
 Manages state using `this.state`
 Uses lifecycle methods like:

   `componentDidMount`
   `componentDidUpdate`
   `componentWillUnmount`
 Requires `this` keyword frequently
 More verbose and harder to read

### Mental model

Think of class components as:

> “Objects with lifecycle phases and internal state handled through methods.”

### Downsides

 Boilerplate-heavy
 Confusing `this` binding
 Harder to reuse logic
 More error-prone for beginners

---

## 2. What is a Function Component?

A function component is a plain JavaScript function that returns UI.

Originally, function components were stateless.
That changed with the introduction of Hooks.

### Key characteristics

 Uses functions
 State & side effects handled using Hooks
 No `this`
 Cleaner, shorter, more readable
 Easier logic reuse via custom hooks

### Mental model

Think of function components as:

> “Pure functions enhanced with hooks to manage state and lifecycle behavior.”

## 3. Lifecycle: Class vs Function (Conceptual Mapping)

| Class Component        | Function Component              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `constructor`          | `useState`                      |
| `componentDidMount`    | `useEffect ([])`                |
| `componentDidUpdate`   | `useEffect ([deps])`            |
| `componentWillUnmount` | cleanup function in `useEffect` |
| `this.state`           | `useState`                      |
| `this.setState`        | state setter function           |

👉 Hooks replace lifecycle methods entirely.

---

## 4. State Management Comparison

### Class Components

 State is an object
 Updates are merged automatically
 Uses `this.setState`

### Function Components

 State is independent variables
 Updates are explicit
 Multiple `useState` calls allowed
 Easier to reason about changes

This makes function components more predictable and modular.

---

## 5. Logic Reusability

### Class Components

 Logic reuse required:

   Higher Order Components (HOCs)
   Render props
 These patterns increase complexity

### Function Components

 Logic reuse via custom hooks
 Clean, readable, composable
 Industry-standard approach

👉 This is one of the biggest reasons hooks won.

---

## 6. Performance Considerations

 Function components are lighter
 No class instantiation
 Easier for React to optimize
 Better compatibility with modern React features like:

   Concurrent rendering
   Server components

Performance difference isn’t massive for small apps, but scales better with function components.

---

## 7. Current Industry Standard (Very Important)

 Class components are NOT deprecated
 But:

   New React features target function components
   Official React docs now teach functions first
   Most production codebases use functions + hooks

👉 If you’re learning React in 2026:

> Function components are mandatory knowledge
> Class components are legacy knowledge

---

## 8. When Would You Still See Class Components?

 Old enterprise projects
 Legacy codebases
 Some older tutorials
 Maintenance work

Knowing them helps you read and refactor, not write new code.

## 9. Quick Comparison Summary

| Feature              | Function Component | Class Component     |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Syntax               | Simple             | Verbose             |
| State                | Hooks              | `this.state`        |
| Lifecycle            | Hooks              | Lifecycle methods   |
| `this` keyword       | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes               |
| Logic reuse          | Custom hooks       | HOCs / render props |
| Modern React support | ✅ Full             | ❌ Limited           |
| Recommended today    | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No                |

## Final Verdict

Use Function Components for everything new.
Understand Class Components to read legacy code.
