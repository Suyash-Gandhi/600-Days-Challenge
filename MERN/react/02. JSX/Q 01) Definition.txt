## 2. JSX – syntax, rules, and why it’s needed

JSX is one of those things in React that feels weird at first (“Why am I writing HTML inside JavaScript?”) but once it clicks, React suddenly makes a lot of sense. Let’s break it down properly.

---

## What JSX actually is

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

 It lets you write UI markup that looks like HTML directly inside JavaScript.
 Browsers do not understand JSX.
 JSX is compiled (by Babel) into plain JavaScript function calls before it runs.

So JSX is not a new language, and it’s not HTML.
It’s just a syntax sugar to make React code readable and expressive.

---

## Why JSX is needed in React

### 1. UI and logic are tightly connected

In traditional web development:

 HTML → structure
 CSS → styling
 JS → logic

In React:

 A component controls structure + logic + behavior together.

JSX allows this co-location:

 Conditions
 Loops
 Props
 Event handlers

all live right next to the UI they affect.

Without JSX, React code becomes hard to read very quickly.

---

### 2. JSX is more readable than plain React API calls

JSX:

```js
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
```

Without JSX (what React actually uses internally):

```js
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World");
```

Now imagine a full page UI written like that 😵‍💫
JSX exists to save your sanity.

---

### 3. JavaScript power inside UI

With JSX, UI is not static markup.

You can:

 Use variables
 Run expressions
 Render conditionally
 Render lists dynamically

This is the core reason React scales well for complex apps.

---

## JSX syntax rules (very important)

JSX looks like HTML, but it follows JavaScript rules, not HTML rules.

---

### 1. You must return a single parent element

❌ Invalid:

```js
return (
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
);
```

✅ Valid:

```js
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </div>
);
```

or using fragments:

```js
return (
  <>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  </>
);
```

Reason: JSX compiles to one JavaScript expression, so it must have one root.

---

### 2. JavaScript expressions go inside `{}`

JSX does not allow statements, only expressions.

✅ Allowed:

```js
<h1>{user.name}</h1>
<h1>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome" : "Please login"}</h1>
```

❌ Not allowed:

```js
<h1>{if (isLoggedIn) { ... }}</h1>
```

Think of `{}` as:

> “Pause JSX, run JavaScript here.”

---

### 3. Attribute names are camelCase

Because JSX becomes JavaScript:

| HTML     | JSX       |
| -------- | --------- |
| class    | className |
| for      | htmlFor   |
| onclick  | onClick   |
| tabindex | tabIndex  |

Example:

```js
<button className="btn" onClick={handleClick}>
  Click me
</button>
```

---

### 4. All tags must be properly closed

HTML allows this:

```html
<img src="logo.png">
```

JSX does not.

JSX requires:

```js
<img src="logo.png" />
```

Same for:

 `<input />`
 `<br />`
 `<hr />`

Reason: JSX follows XML-style strictness.

---

### 5. JSX values are JavaScript, not strings

❌ Wrong:

```js
<button disabled="true">Submit</button>
```

✅ Correct:

```js
<button disabled={true}>Submit</button>
```

Same for:

```js
<input maxLength={10} />
```

If it’s not text, it’s probably JavaScript.

---

### 6. You cannot use reserved JavaScript keywords

For example:

 `class` → `className`
 `for` → `htmlFor`

Because JSX runs inside JavaScript, JavaScript rules win.

---

## JSX is expressions, not templates

This is a key mental shift.

JSX:

 Is not a string
 Is not a template
 Is not HTML

JSX:

 Evaluates to a JavaScript object
 That object describes what the UI should look like

That’s why you can do things like:

 Assign JSX to variables
 Pass JSX as props
 Return JSX from functions

---

## What happens to JSX under the hood

This:

```js
const element = <h1>Hello</h1>;
```

Becomes something like:

```js
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
```

React then:

1. Creates a virtual representation
2. Compares changes (Virtual DOM)
3. Updates the real DOM efficiently

JSX is just the developer-friendly layer on top.

---

## When JSX feels confusing (normal phase)

Most beginners struggle because:

 It looks like HTML
 It behaves like JavaScript

Once you accept:

> “JSX is JavaScript first, markup second”

everything becomes easier.

---

## Key takeaways (lock these in)

 JSX is syntax sugar for `React.createElement`
 Browsers don’t understand JSX → Babel compiles it
 JSX allows dynamic, logic-driven UI
 It follows JavaScript rules, not HTML rules
 `{}` is your gateway from JSX to JavaScript
