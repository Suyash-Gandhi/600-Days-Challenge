## 6. Event Handling in React (Synthetic Events)

Event handling in React is how we respond to user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, key presses, mouse movements, etc. React provides a Synthetic Event system, which is slightly different from traditional DOM event handling.

---

# 1️⃣ What is Event Handling in React?

In React, events are handled using:

 CamelCase naming (`onClick`, `onChange`)
 JSX attributes
 Functions as event handlers

### ✅ Basic Example

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Key Points:

 `onClick` is camelCase (not `onclick`)
 We pass a function reference, not a function call
 React automatically handles event binding in function components

---

# 2️⃣ What Are Synthetic Events?

A Synthetic Event is a wrapper around the browser’s native event.

React creates its own event system to ensure:

 Cross-browser compatibility
 Consistent behavior across all browsers
 Better performance via event delegation

### Definition:

> A Synthetic Event is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event object, following the W3C event specification.

---

# 3️⃣ How Synthetic Events Work Internally

React uses event delegation:

 Instead of attaching events to every DOM node,
 React attaches a single event listener at the root,
 Then internally manages which component triggered the event.

This improves performance, especially in large applications.

---

# 4️⃣ Accessing Event Object

React passes the synthetic event object automatically.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    console.log(event);
    console.log(event.target);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click
    </button>
  );
};
```

You can access:

 `event.target`
 `event.preventDefault()`
 `event.stopPropagation()`

---

# 5️⃣ Prevent Default Behavior

In normal HTML:

```html
<form onsubmit="return false;">
```

In React:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log("Form submitted");
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

React requires explicit use of `e.preventDefault()`.

---

# 6️⃣ Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

If you want to pass parameters:

### ❌ Wrong way:

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick(5)}>Click</button>
```

This executes immediately.

### ✅ Correct way:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => handleClick(5)}>
  Click
</button>
```

Example:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const handleClick = (id) => {
    console.log("ID:", id);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={() => handleClick(10)}>
      Click
    </button>
  );
};
```

---

# 7️⃣ Handling Input Events

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    console.log(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <input type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
  );
};
```

Used commonly in:

 Controlled components
 Forms
 Search inputs

---

# 8️⃣ Event Binding in Class Components (Important for Interviews)

In class components, `this` must be handled properly.

### Method 1: Bind in Constructor

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    console.log("Clicked");
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click</button>;
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Arrow Function (Recommended)

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Clicked");
  };

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click</button>;
  }
}
```

# 9️⃣ React Events vs Native DOM Events

| Feature          | React             | Native DOM            |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Naming           | CamelCase         | lowercase             |
| Event object     | SyntheticEvent    | Native Event          |
| Event attachment | Delegated at root | Attached individually |
| Cross-browser    | Consistent        | May vary              |

---

# 🔟 Event Propagation (Bubbling)

React follows the same event bubbling model.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const parentClick = () => {
    console.log("Parent clicked");
  };

  const childClick = (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    console.log("Child clicked");
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={parentClick}>
      <button onClick={childClick}>
        Click
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

If `stopPropagation()` is removed:

 Child click
 Then parent click (bubbling)

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Important Interview Points

1. React uses Synthetic Events
2. Events are camelCase
3. We pass function references
4. React uses event delegation
5. Must use `preventDefault()` manually
6. Arrow functions avoid binding issues
7. Synthetic events are pooled (older versions) – React 17+ removed pooling

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Best Practices

✔ Keep event handlers small
✔ Avoid inline complex logic in JSX
✔ Use separate functions
✔ Use controlled components for forms
✔ Use arrow functions in class components

---

# 🔎 Final Summary

React event handling:

 Uses SyntheticEvent
 Ensures cross-browser consistency
 Uses event delegation for performance
 Requires camelCase syntax
 Requires explicit `preventDefault()`

Understanding synthetic events helps you write scalable, optimized React applications.
