### 8. Fragments & short syntax (`<>...</>`)

Fragments are a feature in React that let you group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node. Think of them as an invisible wrapper.

---

#### Why Fragments exist

In React, a component must return one parent element. Before fragments, developers often wrapped everything in an extra `<div>`, which caused:

 Unnecessary DOM nodes
 Broken layouts (especially with flex/grid, tables, lists)
 Messy HTML structure

Fragments solve this cleanly.

---

#### What a Fragment actually does

 Groups sibling elements
 Renders nothing extra in the DOM
 Keeps HTML output clean and semantically correct

So instead of:

> “I’ll add one more `<div>` just to make React happy”

You say:

> “Group these elements, but don’t touch my DOM.”

---

#### Short syntax: `<>...</>`

React provides a short-hand fragment syntax:

 `<>` works like a fragment
 `</>` closes it
 No props allowed (important!)

This is the most commonly used form in day-to-day React work because it’s:

 Cleaner
 Faster to read
 Less visual noise

---

#### When you should use Fragments

Use fragments when:

 Returning multiple sibling elements from a component
 Rendering table rows (`tr`, `td`) correctly
 Avoiding layout bugs caused by extra wrappers
 Keeping semantic HTML intact

In modern React projects, fragments are considered best practice, not optional.

---

#### When short syntax won’t work

The short syntax `<>...</>` cannot accept props.

So if you need:

 `key` (very common when rendering lists)
 Any attribute at all

You must use the full fragment form instead.

Rule of thumb:

 No props needed → short syntax
 Props needed → full fragment

---

#### Performance & best practices

 Fragments do not add DOM nodes → better performance
 Cleaner DOM = easier debugging
 Preferred over unnecessary `<div>` wrappers
 Widely used in production-grade React apps

---

#### Mental model (easy to remember)

> A Fragment is a logical wrapper, not a visual wrapper

If it shouldn’t exist in the DOM, it shouldn’t be a `<div>` — use a Fragment.
