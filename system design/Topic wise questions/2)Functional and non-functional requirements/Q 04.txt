Q4. Give three examples of functional requirements and three 
examples of non-functional requirements for an e-commerce 
website.

=> . Functional Requirements (FRs): 
These define the specific actions or behaviors the system must 
perform:

1. User Registration & Login: The system must allow users to 
create accounts, log in, and recover passwords.

2. Product Catalog & Search: Users must be able to browse 
products, filter by category, and search for specific items.

3. Shopping Cart & Checkout: Users must be able to add items to a 
cart, update quantities, and complete purchases with payment integration.

2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs): 
These define how well the system performs or its quality 
attributes:

1. Performance: The website should load product pages within 
2 seconds even during peak traffic.

2. Security: All payment transactions must be encrypted using 
industry-standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).

3. Scalability & Reliability: The system should support at 
least 10,000 concurrent users without downtime and maintain 
99.9% uptime.
