Q1. What are functional requirements in system design? Give two 
simple examples.

=> Functional requirements describe the specific functions, 
operations, and behaviors a system must perform to satisfy 
user needs or business goals.

They are user-facing → directly visible in how the system behaves.
They are usually written as actions the system must support.
They answer the question: “What must the system do?”

Think of them as the verbs of the system.

🔹 Characteristics of Functional Requirements

Task-oriented → tied to business logic and user actions.

Deterministic → for the same input, they produce the same output.

Testable → you can check if the function works or not.

Critical for usability → without them, the system won’t serve its purpose.

🔹 Examples

Authentication – The system must allow users to register, 
log in, and reset passwords.

Search Feature – The system must let users search for products 
by name or category.

Payment Processing – The system must process payments through 
credit cards or UPI.

Order Tracking – The system must allow users to track the 
status of their orders.
