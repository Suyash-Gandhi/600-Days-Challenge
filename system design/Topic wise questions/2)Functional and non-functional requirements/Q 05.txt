Q5. In a banking system, how would you classify requirements 
related to transaction accuracy and system uptime of 99.99%?

=> 1. Transaction Accuracy:

This is a functional requirement because it defines a 
specific system action — ensuring that financial transactions 
are processed correctly.

Example: When a user transfers ₹10,000 from Account A to 
Account B, the system must debit exactly ₹10,000 from A and 
credit exactly ₹10,000 to B.

Reason: Functional requirements specify what the system must 
do, and processing transactions accurately is a core system 
function in banking.

2. System Uptime of 99.99%:

This is a non-functional requirement because it defines how 
well the system performs rather than what it does.

Example: 99.99% uptime means the system should be available 
and operational almost all the time, allowing customers to 
access their accounts, make transactions, and check balances 
reliably.

Reason: Non-functional requirements specify quality attributes 
like availability, reliability, and performance.
