Q6. How can non-functional requirements be measured and 
validated, given that they are often qualitative?

=> Non-functional requirements (NFRs) describe the quality 
attributes of a system, such as performance, scalability, 
security, usability, and maintainability. Unlike functional 
requirements, which can be tested with “pass/fail” outputs, 
NFRs are often qualitative and abstract. This makes measuring 
and validating them challenging, but essential, since they 
directly affect user satisfaction and system reliability.

1. The Challenge of Measuring NFRs

Many NFRs are expressed vaguely, e.g., “The system should be 
fast” or “The system should be user-friendly.”

Without quantifiable criteria, validation becomes subjective.

Therefore, qualitative NFRs must be translated into measurable,
testable metrics.

2. Methods of Measurement & Validation
(a) Performance-related NFRs

Example: “The website should load quickly.”

Metric: Response time ≤ 200 ms, Throughput ≥ 10,000 requests/second.

Validation: Load testing, stress testing, benchmarking.

(b) Scalability

Example: “The system should handle growth.”

Metric: Ability to scale horizontally to handle 1M users with 
<5% latency increase.

Validation: Simulating traffic spikes, cloud elasticity tests.

(c) Reliability & Availability

Example: “The system should be highly available.”

Metric: Uptime of 99.99% per SLA.

Validation: Monitoring logs, failure injection (e.g., Chaos 
Monkey).

(d) Security

Example: “The system should be secure.”

Metric: Number of vulnerabilities found in penetration tests 
≤ X, compliance with OWASP Top 10.

Validation: Penetration testing, audits, vulnerability scanning.

(e) Usability

Example: “The application should be user-friendly.”

Metric: Average task completion time ≤ 2 minutes, user error 
rate ≤ 3%, satisfaction score ≥ 4/5.

Validation: Usability testing, surveys, A/B testing.

(f) Maintainability

Example: “The system should be easy to maintain.”

Metric: Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) ≤ 2 hours, code coverage ≥ 80%.

Validation: Code reviews, static analysis tools.

3. Best Practices for Validating NFRs

Convert vague statements into SMART goals (Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

Instead of “fast” → “API should return results in <200ms 95% 
of the time.”

Use automated monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack) 
for continuous validation.

Define clear acceptance criteria for each NFR in the system 
design documentation.

Run tests under real-world conditions (peak traffic, concurrent 
users, geographic distribution).

Iteratively refine NFRs as system usage grows and business 
needs evolve.
