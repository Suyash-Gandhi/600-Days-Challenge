What is system design & why it matters

=> System design is the process of defining the architecture, 
components, interfaces, and data flow of a system to meet 
specific requirements. In simpler words, itâ€™s about figuring 
out how different parts of a software system (like databases, 
servers, APIs, user interfaces, and external services) should 
interact with each other so that the system is efficient, 
reliable, and scalable.

ðŸ”¹ What System Design Is:

High-level blueprint: It describes how a system will be 
structured (e.g., clientâ€“server, microservices, event-driven).

Problem-solving: It focuses on how to meet functional needs 
(what the system does) and non-functional needs (performance, 
scalability, reliability, maintainability, security).

Trade-offs: It involves choosing the right tools, technologies, 
and patterns for the problem while balancing cost, speed, and 
complexity.

Example:

If youâ€™re asked to design a URL shortener like Bit.ly, 
you wonâ€™t just code it. Youâ€™ll think about:

How to store billions of URLs efficiently
How to ensure unique short links
How to handle millions of users clicking at the same time
How to prevent abuse/spam

Thatâ€™s system design in action.

ðŸ”¹ Why System Design Matters:

Scalability:

A small app may work for 1,000 users, but what happens at 
1 million or 100 million?
Good system design ensures the system grows without breaking.

Performance:

Poorly designed systems become slow and unresponsive under load.
Design decisions like caching, database indexing, and load 
balancing directly affect speed.

Reliability & Fault Tolerance:

Systems crash, servers go down, networks fail.
A solid design makes sure the system continues to work 
(e.g., via redundancy, replication, failover).

Maintainability & Flexibility:

A cleanly designed system is easier to modify, debug, or extend.
Without good design, adding new features can break existing ones.


âœ… In short:
System design is the bridge between coding and building 
real-world, large-scale applications. It matters because it 
determines whether a system will work reliably at scale, adapt 
to growth, and remain usable in the long term.
