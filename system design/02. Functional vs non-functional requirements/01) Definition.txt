## 1. What are Functional Requirements (FR)?

Functional requirements describe what the system should do.
They define features, behaviors, and actions the system must perform.

Think of them as:

> “If a user does X, the system should do Y.”

### Simple definition

Functional requirements = system capabilities

### Examples (very concrete)

 User can register using email and password
 User can log in
 User can search products
 User can place an order
 Admin can block a user
 System sends a password reset email

### Example (real project – e-commerce)

 User can add items to cart
 User can remove items from cart
 User can checkout using UPI / card
 System generates an order ID after payment

If you remove a functional requirement → a feature disappears.

## 2. What are Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)?

Non-functional requirements describe how well the system should work.
They define quality attributes, constraints, and system behavior under load.

Think of them as:

> “How fast, how secure, how reliable, how scalable?”

### Simple definition

Non-functional requirements = system qualities

### Common categories of NFRs

 Performance
 Scalability
 Availability
 Security
 Reliability
 Maintainability
 Usability
 Consistency

---

## 3. Examples of Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

 API response time should be < 200 ms
 Page should load within 2 seconds

### Scalability

 System should handle 1 million users
 Should support 10x traffic during sales

### Availability

 System uptime should be 99.9%
 No single point of failure

### Security

 Passwords must be hashed
 APIs must require authentication
 Data must be encrypted at rest and in transit

### Reliability

 No data loss during server crash
 Messages should not be duplicated

### Maintainability

 Code should be modular
 Easy to add new features

If you remove a non-functional requirement →
the feature still exists, but works poorly or fails under real conditions.

## 4. Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect         | Functional       | Non-Functional                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Focus          | What system does | How system behaves              |
| Defines        | Features         | Quality & constraints           |
| User visible   | Yes              | Mostly indirect                 |
| Example        | “User can login” | “Login should take < 300 ms”    |
| Failure impact | Feature missing  | System slow, insecure, unstable |

---

## 5. Example: Login Feature (FR + NFR together)

### Functional Requirements

 User can log in using email & password
 User sees error on wrong credentials

### Non-Functional Requirements

 Login response time < 200 ms
 Password stored using bcrypt
 Login API should handle 10k concurrent users
 Account locked after 5 failed attempts

👉 Real systems always need BOTH

## 6. How They Are Used in System Design

### Functional Requirements help you decide:

 APIs needed
 Database tables
 User flows
 Business logic

### Non-Functional Requirements help you decide:

 Architecture (monolith vs microservices)
 Caching (Redis)
 Load balancers
 Database type
 Replication & backups

Example:

 FR: “User can upload images”
 NFR: “Image upload should support 10MB files and serve images globally with low latency”
  → leads to object storage + CDN

## 7. Beginner Mistake (Very Common)

❌ Writing only functional requirements
✅ Writing functional AND non-functional together

Bad:

> “User can watch videos”

Good:

> “User can watch videos at 1080p with buffering < 1 second for 95% users”

---

## 8. Rule of Thumb (Very Important)

 FR = product correctness
 NFR = production readiness

A system with only FRs:

 Works in demo
 Fails in real world

A system with FR + NFR:

 Scales
 Survives traffic
 Feels “professional”
