## 3. Java Program Structure

A Java program follows a strict, well-defined structure. Understanding this structure is fundamental because every Java application—small or enterprise-level—builds on the same skeleton. Below is a complete, university-level explanation, written step-by-step, with clarity and depth.

## 1. Basic Layout of a Java Program

A typical Java program consists of the following components in logical order:

1. Documentation comments
2. Package statement (optional)
3. Import statements (optional)
4. Class declaration
5. Main method
6. Statements (program logic)

Each component has a specific role and rules enforced by the Java compiler.

---

## 2. Documentation Comments

These are comments written for developers and documentation tools, not for execution.

 Written using `/ ... /`
 Used by Javadoc to generate documentation
 Usually placed before classes and methods

Purpose:

 Describe what the program/class/method does
 Improve maintainability and readability

Example description (no code):

> Explains the purpose of the program, author name, version, and date.

---

## 3. Package Statement

The `package` statement defines the namespace of the class.

### Key Points:

 Must be the first executable line in the program
 Groups related classes together
 Helps avoid name conflicts
 Used extensively in large applications

Example:

 `package com.company.project;`

If omitted:

 The class belongs to the default package (not recommended in real projects)

---

## 4. Import Statements

Import statements allow access to predefined or user-defined classes from other packages.

### Key Points:

 Written after the package statement
 Makes code shorter and readable
 Without import, you must use fully qualified class names

Example usage:

 Importing utility classes (Scanner, List, etc.)

---

## 5. Class Declaration

Every Java program must have at least one class.

### Syntax Concept:

 Uses the `class` keyword
 Class name must match the filename
 Class names follow PascalCase

Rules:

 A Java file can contain multiple classes
 Only one public class per file
 Public class name = file name

Purpose:

 Acts as a blueprint
 Contains variables, methods, and logic

---

## 6. Main Method

The `main` method is the entry point of any standalone Java application.

### Standard Signature:

 `public static void main(String[] args)`

### Explanation of keywords:

 public → Accessible by JVM from anywhere
 static → No object needed to run
 void → Returns nothing
 String[] args → Command-line arguments

### Important:

 JVM looks only for this exact signature
 Without it, the program will not execute

---

## 7. Statements (Program Logic)

Inside the `main` method, we write executable statements.

These may include:

 Variable declarations
 Input/output statements
 Control structures (if, loops)
 Method calls
 Object creation

Execution Flow:

 Statements run top to bottom
 Ends when the `main` method finishes execution

---

## 8. Complete Logical Flow of Execution

1. Source file (`.java`) is written
2. Compiler (`javac`) checks syntax
3. Bytecode (`.class`) is generated
4. JVM loads the class
5. JVM calls the `main` method
6. Statements execute sequentially
7. Program terminates

---

## 9. Important Rules to Remember (Exam-Focused)

 Java programs are class-based
 `main` method is mandatory for execution
 File name must match public class name
 Package statement comes before import
 Execution always starts from `main`

---

## 10. Why Java Enforces This Structure

 Platform independence
 Strong security model
 Better memory management
 Clean separation of responsibilities
 Scalability for enterprise systems
