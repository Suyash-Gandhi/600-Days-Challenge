## Differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM


### 1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Definition:
JVM is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode.

Key Points:

 JVM does not compile code; it only executes `.class` files.
 It makes Java platform-independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere).
 Different OS have different JVM implementations, but bytecode remains the same.

Main Responsibilities:

 Loads bytecode (Class Loader)
 Verifies bytecode
 Executes bytecode (Interpreter + JIT compiler)
 Manages memory (Heap, Stack, Garbage Collection)

Important Note:
JVM is part of JRE, not a standalone user tool.

### 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Definition:
JRE provides the environment required to run Java applications, but not to develop them.

Key Points:

 Contains JVM + Core Java Libraries + Supporting files
 Used by end users who only want to run Java programs
 Cannot compile Java source code (`.java`)

Components of JRE:

 JVM
 Java class libraries (java.lang, java.util, etc.)
 Runtime supporting files

Example Use Case:
If you download a Java-based application and only want to run it, JRE is sufficient.

### 3. JDK (Java Development Kit)

Definition:
JDK is a full-featured software development kit used to develop, compile, debug, and run Java applications.

Key Points:

 Contains JRE + Development tools
 Required by Java developers
 Can both compile and execute Java programs

Major Tools in JDK:

 `javac` – Java compiler
 `java` – Program launcher
 `javadoc` – Documentation generator
 `jar` – Package manager
 Debugging and monitoring tools

Important Note:
Without JDK, Java development is not possible.

### 4. Relationship between JDK, JRE, and JVM

```
JDK
 └── JRE
      └── JVM
```

 JVM executes the program
 JRE provides the runtime environment
 JDK provides tools for development + JRE

| Feature            | JVM               | JRE                | JDK                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Purpose            | Executes bytecode | Runs Java programs | Develops & runs Java programs |
| Contains           | Execution engine  | JVM + libraries    | JRE + dev tools               |
| Can compile code   | ❌ No              | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                         |
| Used by            | Runtime system    | End users          | Developers                    |
| Platform dependent | Yes               | Yes                | Yes                           |

### 6. Simple One-Line Summary (Exam-friendly)

 JVM → Executes Java bytecode
 JRE → Provides environment to run Java programs
 JDK → Provides tools to develop and run Java programs
