## First, forget the name PBFT for a minute

Imagine this situation 👇

You have 4 computers (nodes) that must all agree on one decision
(example: “Did Alice send 5 coins to Bob?”)

But here’s the problem:

 1 computer might be faulty
 Or lying
 Or hacked
 Or just acting weird

Yet you still want all honest computers to agree on the same answer.

That’s exactly the problem PBFT solves.

---

## The ONE rule PBFT follows (very important)

PBFT works only if:

> Less than 1/3 of nodes are bad

So:

 4 nodes → 1 can be bad ✅
 7 nodes → 2 can be bad ✅
 10 nodes → 3 can be bad ❌ (too many)

If more than 1/3 are bad → PBFT cannot guarantee correctness.

---

## Who does what? (Very simple roles)

In PBFT there are only two roles:

### 1️⃣ Leader (Primary)

 One node acts like a coordinator
 It says:
  👉 “Here is the transaction order we should agree on”

### 2️⃣ Other nodes (Replicas)

 They check
 They vote
 They cross-check each other

If the leader lies → others catch it.

---

## Now the CORE IDEA (this is the key)

PBFT does NOT trust one node.

Instead:

 Nodes talk to each other
 They verify what others heard
 Decision is made only when most nodes agree

Think of it like:

> “I won’t believe this unless many of you tell me the same thing.”

---

## PBFT works in 3 simple rounds (this is the heart)

Let’s say there are 4 nodes:
A (leader), B, C, D

Client sends a request:

> “Transfer 5 coins from Alice to Bob”

---

### 🟢 Round 1: PRE-PREPARE (Leader speaks)

Leader A says to everyone:

> “This is the transaction, this is its order”

Everyone receives the same message.

If leader sends different messages to different nodes → they’ll notice later.

---

### 🟡 Round 2: PREPARE (Nodes cross-check)

Now B, C, D talk to each other:

They basically ask:

> “What did the leader tell you?”

If:

 B, C, D all heard the same thing → good
 Someone hears something different → leader is suspicious

When a node sees enough matching confirmations, it moves forward.

---

### 🔴 Round 3: COMMIT (Final agreement)

Now nodes say:

> “Okay, I’m committing this transaction”

When a node receives enough commit messages, the decision becomes final.

🚫 No rollback
🚫 No fork
🚫 No “maybe later”

---

## What happens if the leader is bad?

PBFT is smart here 👇

If:

 Leader is slow
 Leader sends conflicting data
 Leader doesn’t behave properly

Then nodes remove the leader and:

> Choose a new leader automatically

This is called a view change
(you don’t need details right now)

---

## Why PBFT is FAST

Because:

 No mining
 No puzzles
 No waiting for confirmations

Once nodes agree → done.

That’s why PBFT is popular in:

 Banks
 Enterprises
 Consortium blockchains

---

## Why PBFT is NOT used in Bitcoin / Ethereum mainnet

Because:

 Every node must talk to every other node
 Messages increase very fast as nodes grow

So:

 10 nodes → okay
 100 nodes → heavy
 10,000 nodes → impossible

Also:

 PBFT requires known identities
 Public blockchains have anonymous users

---

## One sentence that actually makes sense

> PBFT is a way for known computers to agree on transactions by repeatedly checking with each other, so that even if some lie, the honest majority still agrees on one final answer.
