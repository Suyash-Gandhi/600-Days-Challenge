## 1. Deterministic

Meaning

 The same input will always produce the same hash output.

Why it matters

 If I hash `"Hello"` today or tomorrow, on any computer, the output is identical.
 This consistency allows different blockchain nodes to independently verify data.

Blockchain context

 Every node can recompute a block hash and confirm it matches the stored value.

---

## 2. Fixed Output Length

Meaning

 No matter how big or small the input is, the hash output has a fixed size.

Example

 Input: `"A"` → 256-bit output
 Input: `"A very long transaction list..."` → still 256-bit output

Why it matters

 Makes storage predictable.
 Enables efficient comparison and indexing.

Blockchain context

 Block hashes remain uniform even though blocks contain different amounts of data.

---

## 3. Fast to Compute (Efficient)

Meaning

 Computing the hash of any input is computationally easy and fast.

Why it matters

 Nodes must hash data constantly (transactions, blocks).
 Verification should be cheap.

Blockchain context

 Validators/miners can quickly verify transactions and blocks.

---

## 4. Pre-image Resistance (One-Way Property)

Meaning

 Given a hash value, it is computationally infeasible to find the original input.

In simple terms

 You can go input → hash
 But you cannot go hash → input

Why it matters

 Protects sensitive data.

Blockchain context

 Wallet addresses are derived from public keys via hashing.
 Even if you see the hash, you can’t reverse it to steal keys.

---

## 5. Second Pre-image Resistance

Meaning

 Given an input `X`, it is infeasible to find a different input `Y` such that
  `hash(X) = hash(Y)`

Why it matters

 Prevents attackers from replacing legitimate data with fake data that has the same hash.

Blockchain context

 A transaction cannot be swapped with another transaction without changing the block hash.

---

## 6. Collision Resistance

Meaning

 It is infeasible to find any two different inputs that produce the same hash.

Important distinction

 Collisions are theoretically possible (finite hash space)
 But practically impossible with secure hash functions

Why it matters

 Ensures data integrity.

Blockchain context

 Two different blocks cannot realistically have the same hash.
 Prevents double-spending and fraud.

---

## 7. Avalanche Effect

Meaning

 A small change in input results in a completely different hash.

Example intuition

 Changing one letter or one bit flips ~50% of output bits.

Why it matters

 Makes patterns impossible to detect.
 Enhances security.

Blockchain context

 Even a tiny change in a transaction changes the entire block hash.
 This is why tampering with old blocks is easily detected.

---

## 8. Pseudo-Randomness

Meaning

 Hash outputs appear random, even for similar inputs.

Why it matters

 Prevents attackers from predicting hashes.
 Enhances security against pattern-based attacks.

Blockchain context

 Block hashes look random, making manipulation extremely difficult.

---

## 9. Non-Reversibility Without Brute Force

Meaning

 The only way to guess the original input is by trying all possibilities.

Why it matters

 With modern hash sizes (e.g., 256-bit), brute force is computationally infeasible.

Blockchain context

 Protects passwords, private keys, and transaction commitments.
