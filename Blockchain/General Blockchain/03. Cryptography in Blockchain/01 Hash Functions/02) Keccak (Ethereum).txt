## 1. What is Keccak?

Keccak is a cryptographic hash function.

In simple words:
👉 It takes any input data and converts it into a fixed-length output (a hash) that looks random.

Example idea (not real values):

```
"hello"  →  0x3f8a9c...
"hello!" →  0x91bd02...
```

Even tiny input changes → completely different output.

## 2. Why Ethereum uses Keccak

Ethereum uses Keccak-256 as its core hashing algorithm.

Ethereum calls it `keccak256`.

It is used for:

 Creating transaction hashes
 Creating block hashes
 Generating contract addresses
 Hashing function signatures
 Storage & state verification

👉 Without Keccak, Ethereum cannot function securely.

## 3. Keccak vs SHA-3 (very important exam/interview point)

This is where many people get confused.

| Feature            | Keccak              | SHA-3                |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Relationship       | Original algorithm  | Standardized version |
| Used by Ethereum   | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No                 |
| Padding difference | Different           | Different            |
| Output size        | 256 bits (Ethereum) | 256 bits             |

⚠️ Ethereum uses the pre-standard version of Keccak, not the final SHA-3 standard.

That’s why:

```
keccak256("abc") ≠ sha3_256("abc")
```

## 4. What makes Keccak special? (Sponge construction)

Keccak uses a Sponge Function.

### Simple mental model:

 You absorb input data into a sponge
 You squeeze out the hash

### Why this matters:

 Strong resistance to attacks
 Flexible output size
 Efficient and secure

This design is different from SHA-2 (Bitcoin), which uses Merkle–Damgård construction.

---

## 5. How Ethereum actually uses Keccak

### (a) Transaction Hash

Every Ethereum transaction is hashed using `keccak256` to get a transaction ID.

```
Transaction data → keccak256 → tx hash
```

---

### (b) Block Hash

Blocks are identified using Keccak hashes.

```
Block header → keccak256 → block hash
```

---

### (c) Smart Contract Function Calls

Ethereum converts function signatures like:

```
transfer(address,uint256)
```

into:

```
keccak256("transfer(address,uint256)")
```

Then it takes first 4 bytes → function selector.

That’s how Ethereum knows which function to execute.

---

### (d) Contract Address Generation

When a contract is deployed:

```
(sender address + nonce) → keccak256 → contract address
```

---

## 6. Security properties of Keccak

Keccak provides all essential cryptographic guarantees:

1. Deterministic

    Same input → same output

2. Collision resistance

    Extremely hard to find two inputs with same hash

3. Pre-image resistance

    Cannot reverse hash to original data

4. Avalanche effect

    Small input change → massive output change

These properties are critical for blockchain security.

---

## 7. Why Ethereum didn’t switch to SHA-3 later

Good conceptual question.

Ethereum:

 Was already live when SHA-3 was standardized
 Changing hash function would break compatibility
 Risk > benefit

So Ethereum kept Keccak.

---

## 8. One-line summary (perfect for revision)

> Keccak is the cryptographic hash function used by Ethereum to secure transactions, blocks, smart contracts, and state, implemented as keccak256 (not SHA-3).
