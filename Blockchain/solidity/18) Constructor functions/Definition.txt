## 1. Definition

A constructor in Solidity is a special function that is executed only once—when the smart contract is deployed.

 It is used to initialize state variables or perform setup tasks.
 After deployment, the constructor cannot be called again.

---

## 2. Syntax

In Solidity ^0.4.22 and later, constructors are declared using the keyword `constructor`:


pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    uint public count;

    // Constructor
    constructor(uint _count) {
        count = _count;  // initializes state variable
    }
}


Before 0.4.22, constructors were written by giving the function the same name as the contract.

## 3. Key Characteristics

1. Executed Once

    Runs only during deployment, never again.

2. Visibility

    Constructors can only be internal or public.
    They cannot be external or private.

3. No return type

    A constructor does not return any value.

4. Optional

    If not defined, the contract will have a default empty constructor.

---

## 4. Use Cases

1. Initialize State Variables
   Example: setting the contract owner.

   
   address public owner;

   constructor() {
       owner = msg.sender; // deployer becomes owner
   }
   

2. Passing Parameters during Deployment

   
   contract Token {
       string public name;
       uint public totalSupply;

       constructor(string memory _name, uint _supply) {
           name = _name;
           totalSupply = _supply;
       }
   }
   

   While deploying, you must pass values: e.g., `"MyToken", 1000`.

3. Inheritance Initialization

    When contracts inherit from others, parent constructors can be called with parameters.

   
   contract A {
       uint public value;
       constructor(uint _val) {
           value = _val;
       }
   }

   contract B is A {
       constructor(uint _val) A(_val) {
           // Child constructor calls parent constructor
       }
   }
   

---

## 5. Best Practices

 Always initialize critical state variables (e.g., `owner`) inside the constructor.
 Use constructor parameters to make contracts flexible and reusable.
 Avoid heavy computations in constructors since they increase deployment gas costs.

---

## 6. Example of Default Constructor


pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Simple {
    uint public number;

    // No constructor explicitly defined
    // Solidity automatically creates a default one
}


---

✅ Summary:

 Constructor is a special function that runs once at deployment.
 Used to initialize variables, set permissions, and configure contract behavior.
 Supports parameters, inheritance, and is optional.
 Plays a crucial role in smart contract security (e.g., assigning ownership).
