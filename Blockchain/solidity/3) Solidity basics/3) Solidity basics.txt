Here’s a detailed, structured overview of Solidity basics, covering syntax, structure, and comments, explained step by step:

---

 1. Introduction to Solidity

Solidity is a statically-typed, high-level programming language designed for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.

 Influenced by JavaScript, Python, and C++.
 Compiles into EVM bytecode to run on the blockchain.
 Used for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.

 2. Basic Structure of a Solidity Contract

A Solidity file typically follows this structure:

solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;  // Version declaration

// Contract declaration
contract ContractName {
    
    // State variables
    uint public number;
    
    // Constructor
    constructor(uint _number) {
        number = _number;
    }
    
    // Functions
    function setNumber(uint _number) public {
        number = _number;
    }

    function getNumber() public view returns (uint) {
        return number;
    }
}


 Explanation of Components

1. License Identifier

   solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   

    Required by Solidity compiler for open-source licensing.

2. Pragma Directive

   solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
   

    Specifies the compiler version.
    ^ means compatible with versions 0.8.0 and above, but below 0.9.0.

3. Contract Declaration

   solidity
   contract ContractName { ... }
   

    Similar to a class in object-oriented languages.
    Contains variables, functions, and logic.

4. State Variables

   solidity
   uint public number;
   

    Stored on blockchain (persistent).
    public automatically creates a getter function.

5. Constructor

   solidity
   constructor(uint _number) { number = _number; }
   

    Executes once when the contract is deployed.
    Typically used to initialize state variables.

6. Functions

   solidity
   function setNumber(uint _number) public { number = _number; }
   

    Defines behavior of the contract.
    Can have visibility: public, private, internal, external.
    Can be view (read-only) or pure (no state access).

 3. Solidity Syntax Basics

 Data Types

 Unsigned Integers: uint, uint8, uint256
 Signed Integers: int, int256
 Boolean: bool
 Address: address (Ethereum wallet address)
 Bytes: bytes1 to bytes32, bytes
 String: string

 Variables

 State Variables – Stored on blockchain.
 Local Variables – Stored temporarily in function memory.
 Constants – Cannot change after assignment (constant).

 Operators

 Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
 Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
 Logical: &&, ||, !

 4. Comments in Solidity

Solidity supports three types of comments:

1. Single-line comments

solidity
// This is a single-line comment


2. Multi-line comments

solidity
/*
  This is a
  multi-line comment
/*


3. NatSpec comments (Documentation)

solidity
/// @title Simple Counter Contract
/// @author Suyash
/// @notice This contract is for demonstration purposes
/// @dev Explains constructor and functions


 NatSpec comments are used to generate documentation.
 Starts with /// or / /.

---

 5. Example with Comments

solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title Counter Contract
/// @notice Simple contract to demonstrate Solidity basics
contract Counter {

    uint public count; // State variable to store count

    /// @notice Constructor to initialize count
    /// @param _count Initial count value
    constructor(uint _count) {
        count = _count;
    }

    /// @notice Increment count by 1
    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
    }

    /// @notice Returns the current count
    function getCount() public view returns (uint) {
        return count;
    }
}

 6. Summary

 Solidity is the primary language for Ethereum smart contracts.
 Contracts have state variables, constructors, and functions.
 Visibility, data types, and function modifiers are important.
 Comments help in documentation and readability.
