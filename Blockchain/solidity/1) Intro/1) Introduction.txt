 1. Introduction to Blockchain

 Definition

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way.

 Key Characteristics

1. Decentralization – No central authority; the network collectively validates transactions.
2. Transparency – Transactions are visible to all participants.
3. Immutability – Once data is recorded in a block, it cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks.
4. Security – Uses cryptography (hash functions, digital signatures) to ensure data integrity.

 How Blockchain Works

1. Transaction Initiation – A participant requests a transaction (e.g., transferring cryptocurrency).
2. Transaction Verification – Nodes validate the transaction using consensus mechanisms (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake).
3. Block Formation – Verified transactions are bundled into a block.
4. Block Addition – The new block is added to the existing chain in chronological order.
5. Completion – Transaction is complete and visible to the network.

 Example

Imagine a ledger shared among multiple friends. When Alice sends 2 tokens to Bob, everyone’s ledger updates simultaneously. If someone tries to cheat, the network rejects the change.

 2. Blockchain Types

1. Public Blockchain – Open to everyone, e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum.
2. Private Blockchain – Restricted access, controlled by a single organization.
3. Consortium Blockchain – Controlled by a group of organizations.
4. Hybrid Blockchain – Combines public and private features.

 3. Ethereum Overview

 What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

 Ethereum vs Bitcoin

| Feature           | Bitcoin                     | Ethereum                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Purpose           | Digital currency            | Smart contracts & dApps    |
| Blockchain type   | Public, PoW (moving to PoS) | Public, PoS                |
| Programming       | Limited scripting           | Turing-complete (Solidity) |
| Transaction speed | ~10 min per block           | ~13–15 sec per block       |

 Ethereum Components

1. Ether (ETH) – Native cryptocurrency used to pay transaction fees (gas).
2. Smart Contracts – Self-executing contracts with terms written in code.
3. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) – Runs smart contracts on all nodes of the network.
4. dApps – Decentralized applications running on Ethereum.

 4. Smart Contract Example (Conceptual)

```
If Alice sends 5 ETH to Bob,
then Bob receives the tokens automatically,
without any middleman.
```

 Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum.
 Executes automatically when conditions are met.

 5. Advantages of Ethereum

 Automation via smart contracts.
 Reduced reliance on intermediaries.
 Transparency and auditability.
 Programmable money and assets.

 Limitations

 Scalability issues (slow when network congested).
 High gas fees.
 Immutability can be risky if contract has bugs.

 6. Summary

 Blockchain is the foundation: decentralized, secure, and immutable.
 Ethereum builds on blockchain to create programmable, decentralized applications.
 Smart contracts automate processes, removing the need for intermediaries.
