## 1. What are Function Modifiers?

A function modifier is a special construct in Solidity that changes or restricts the behavior of functions.

 They are often used for access control, preconditions, or reusable code.
 Think of them as wrappers around functions that run before, after, or around the function code.

---

## 2. Syntax of a Modifier


modifier modifierName(parameters) {
    // Code before function
    _;
    // Code after function
}


 _ (underscore) represents where the original function’s code will execute.
 Anything before _ runs before the function, and anything after _ runs after the function.

## 3. Common Examples of Modifiers

 a) Access Control Modifier


pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ModifierExample {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // deployer is owner
    }

    // Modifier to allow only owner
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }

    uint public count;

    // Using the modifier
    function increment() public onlyOwner {
        count += 1;
    }
}


 Here, onlyOwner ensures only the contract owner can call increment().
 require() checks a condition and reverts the transaction if false.

---

 b) Modifier with Parameters

Modifiers can also accept parameters:


modifier minValue(uint _value) {
    require(_value >= 10, "Value too low");
    _;
}

function deposit(uint _amount) public minValue(_amount) {
    // Function body executes only if _amount >= 10
}


---

 c) Modifier with Code After Function Execution

You can also run code after the function executes:


modifier logAction() {
    _;
    // Code after function executes
    emit ActionLogged(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}

event ActionLogged(address user, uint time);

function doSomething() public logAction {
    // Function logic
}


 Here, logAction runs after doSomething() completes.

---

## 4. Key Points About Modifiers

1. Reusability: Modifiers avoid repeating code like access checks in every function.
2. Stacking Modifiers: You can use multiple modifiers for a single function:


function transfer(uint _amount) public onlyOwner minValue(_amount) {
    // Function body
}


3. Modifiers vs Functions: Modifiers are not called like normal functions; they wrap function execution.

---

## ✅ Summary

 Modifiers control function execution (before, after, or around).
 Common uses: access control, input validation, logging.
 Syntax uses _ to indicate where the function code runs.
 They can be parameterized and stacked for flexibility.

If you want, I can make a compact table of all common modifiers in Solidity with examples and use-cases so you can memorize them quickly.

Do you want me to make that table?


In Solidity, function modifiers can be both built-in and custom, but it’s important to clarify:

---

## 1. Built-in Modifiers

Solidity itself does not have many “built-in” modifiers like some languages. Most of the commonly seen modifiers in tutorials are actually custom-defined by developers.

However, there are some built-in behavior modifiers:

| Modifier Type    | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| payable          | Allows the function to receive Ether. Without payable, sending Ether to a function will fail. |
| view             | Indicates the function does not modify state. Can only read state variables.                  |
| pure             | Indicates the function does not read or modify state. Cannot access blockchain data.          |
| virtual          | Allows the function to be overridden in derived contracts.                                    |
| override         | Used when a function overrides a base function.                                               |
| constant (old)   | Deprecated; replaced by view for functions that don’t modify state.                           |

These are special keywords that act like modifiers, controlling how the function behaves, but they are not like onlyOwner — they are built into the language.

---

## 2. Custom Modifiers

 Almost every example you see like onlyOwner, minValue, or logAction are custom modifiers defined by the developer.
 They are user-defined rules that wrap a function to enforce conditions or add extra logic.

Example:


modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
    _;
}


Here, onlyOwner is fully custom. Solidity doesn’t provide it by default.

---

 Summary

 Built-in modifiers: payable, view, pure, virtual, override.
 Custom modifiers: Anything you define, e.g., onlyOwner, minValue, logAction.
 Most “control” logic modifiers are custom, while built-in ones are more like behavior specifiers.
