Q4. What happens if you indent the first line of your Python 
program unnecessarily?

=> SyntaxError occurs

Python expects the first line at the top-level scope 
(no indentation). If you start with an indented line, the 
interpreter thinks you are inside a block, but no such block 
exists.

Example:

    print("Hello World")


Output/Error:

IndentationError: unexpected indent

2. Reason

Python uses indentation to group statements into blocks (for 
functions, loops, conditionals, classes).

The first line of a script is always considered top-level, so 
any leading spaces or tabs are invalid unless it’s part of a 
multiline construct.

Unlike languages like C++/Java, Python does not allow 
standalone indentation at the global level.

3. Exception

Indentation is allowed at the beginning if it’s inside a block, 
for example:

def greet():
    print("Hello World")  # correct indentation


But at the very top-level, it’s always an error.
