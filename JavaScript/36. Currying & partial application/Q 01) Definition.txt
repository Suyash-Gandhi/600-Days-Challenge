### 36. Currying & Partial Application (JavaScript)


## 1. What is Currying?

Currying is a technique where a function that normally takes multiple arguments is transformed into a chain of functions, each taking one argument at a time.

### Normal function

```js
const add = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
add(1, 2, 3); // 6
```

### Curried version

```js
const add = a => b => c => a + b + c;

add(1)(2)(3); // 6
```

Instead of one call with three parameters, we call three functions in sequence.

## 2. Why Currying is Useful

Currying allows:

 Reuse of partial logic
 Creating highly flexible, composable functions
 Cleaner functional pipelines
 Avoiding repeated arguments

---

## 3. Partial Application

Partial application means fixing some arguments of a function and producing a new function with fewer parameters.

### Example without currying

```js
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

const double = b => multiply(2, b);
double(5); // 10
```

Here `2` is pre-filled → that’s partial application.

## 4. Currying vs Partial Application

| Feature        | Currying                         | Partial Application          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Transformation | Multi-arg → chain of 1-arg funcs | Pre-filling some arguments   |
| Result         | `f(a)(b)(c)` style               | New function with fewer args |
| Purpose        | Functional composition           | Reuse & specialization       |

## 5. Creating a Generic Curry Function

```js
const curry = fn => {
  const curried = (...args) =>
    args.length >= fn.length
      ? fn(...args)
      : (...next) => curried(...args, ...next);

  return curried;
};

const sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;

const curriedSum = curry(sum);

curriedSum(1)(2)(3);    // 6
curriedSum(1, 2)(3);   // 6
curriedSum(1)(2, 3);   // 6
```

---

## 6. Practical Use Case – Logging System

```js
const log = level => message => `[${level}] ${message}`;

const errorLog = log("ERROR");
const infoLog = log("INFO");

errorLog("Server crashed");
infoLog("User logged in");
```

You fixed `level` once and reused the function everywhere.

---

## 7. Currying with Function Composition

```js
const multiply = a => b => a * b;
const add = a => b => a + b;

const double = multiply(2);
const addTen = add(10);

addTen(double(5)); // 20
```

This becomes extremely powerful when building pipelines.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

 Currying converts
  `f(a, b, c)` → `f(a)(b)(c)`
 Partial application fixes some arguments early.
 Both improve:

   Code reuse
   Readability
   Functional composition

This concept is heavily used in React hooks, Redux middleware, functional libraries like Ramda/Lodash FP, so mastering it will immediately improve your JavaScript design skills.
