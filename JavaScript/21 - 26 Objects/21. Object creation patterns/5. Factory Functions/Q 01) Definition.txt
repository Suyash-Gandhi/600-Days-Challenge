## 1️⃣ What Is a Factory Function?

A factory function is a regular JavaScript function that creates and returns an object.

Instead of using:

 `new` keyword
 Constructor functions
 Classes

You simply return an object manually.

---

## 2️⃣ Basic Structure

```javascript
const createUser = (name, age) => {
  return {
    name,
    age,
    greet() {
      console.log(`Hi, I'm ${name}`);
    }
  };
};

const user1 = createUser("Suyash", 21);
user1.greet();
```

Here:

 `createUser` is the factory function
 Every time you call it, it creates a new object
 No `new` keyword is used

---

## 3️⃣ Why Is It Called "Factory"?

Because like a real factory:

 You give it raw materials (parameters)
 It produces a finished product (object)

It manufactures objects.

---

## 4️⃣ Factory Function vs Constructor Function

### 🔹 Factory Function

```javascript
const createCar = (brand) => {
  return {
    brand
  };
};

const car1 = createCar("BMW");
```

✔ Simple
✔ No `this` confusion
✔ No `new` keyword

---

### 🔹 Constructor Function

```javascript
function Car(brand) {
  this.brand = brand;
}

const car1 = new Car("BMW");
```

✔ Uses `new`
✔ Uses `this`
✔ Linked to prototype automatically

---

## 5️⃣ Advantages of Factory Functions

1. Cleaner syntax
2. No accidental `new` mistakes
3. Easier to use closures
4. Better control over private variables

Example with private data:

```javascript
const createCounter = () => {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment() {
      count++;
    },
    getCount() {
      return count;
    }
  };
};

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
```

Here `count` is private — cannot be accessed directly.

---

## 6️⃣ When Should You Use Factory Functions?

Use them when:

 You want simplicity
 You want private variables
 You don’t need prototype optimization
 You prefer functional style programming

---

## 7️⃣ One Important Note (Performance)

Factory functions create new copies of methods for every object.

Constructor functions + prototypes share methods.

So if you're creating thousands of objects, constructors or classes may be more memory-efficient.

---

## Final Definition (Exam Ready)

> A factory function is a JavaScript function that creates and returns an object without using the `new` keyword. It is a flexible and simple object creation pattern that allows encapsulation and private variables using closures.
