# ✅ Arrays: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach` — Complete Explanation

Array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach` are foundational tools used in modern JavaScript for transforming, processing, and iterating over lists of data. They are considered higher-order functions because they accept another function (callback) as an argument.

These four methods help you write cleaner, more readable, and more expressive code compared to traditional `for` loops.

# ⭐ 1. `map()` – Transformation Method

## ✔ What it does

 Creates a new array.
 Applies a function to each element.
 Returns the transformed value.
 Length of the new array is always equal to original array length.

## ✔ Use-case

When you want to modify or transform every element.

Examples:

 Converting prices (₹ → $)
 Extracting specific fields from objects
 Formatting strings

## ✔ Syntax

```js
const newArray = array.map((value, index, array) => {
    return value;
});
```

## ✔ Example

Convert numbers → their squares.

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const squares = nums.map(n => n  2);
console.log(squares); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## ✔ Key Points

 Does not mutate original array.
 Always returns a new array.
 Perfect for data transformation.

---

# ⭐ 2. `filter()` – Extraction Method

## ✔ What it does

 Creates a new array.
 Only keeps the elements that pass a condition.
 Returned array may be:

   Smaller
   Same size
   Even empty

## ✔ Use-case

Use when you want to choose or select items from a list.

Examples:

 Filter users older than 18
 Filter odd numbers
 Filter products in stock

## ✔ Syntax

```js
const result = array.filter((value, index, array) => {
    return condition; // must be true/false
});
```

## ✔ Example

Select even numbers:

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evens = nums.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]
```

## ✔ Key Points

 Does not modify original array.
 Great for searching, filtering logic.
 Returns a subset.

---

# ⭐ 3. `reduce()` – Accumulation Method

## ✔ What it does

 Reduces the array to a single value.
 Works with:

   Numbers → sum
   Strings → concatenation
   Arrays → flattening
   Objects → grouping

## ✔ Use-case

Perfect when you want a single output from multiple values.

Examples:

 Sum of numbers
 Maximum value
 Counting occurrences
 Transform arrays into objects

## ✔ Syntax

```js
const result = array.reduce((accumulator, value, index, array) => {
    return newAccumulator;
}, initialValue);
```

## ✔ Example 1: Sum of Numbers

```js
const nums = [10, 20, 30];

const sum = nums.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
console.log(sum); // 60
```

## ✔ Example 2: Count occurrences

```js
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a'];

const count = letters.reduce((acc, ch) => {
    acc[ch] = (acc[ch] || 0) + 1;
    return acc;
}, {});

console.log(count); // {a: 3, b: 2, c: 1}
```

## ✔ Key Points

 Most powerful method of the four.
 Can mimic map, filter, and forEach.
 Often used for data analytics.

---

# ⭐ 4. `forEach()` – Iteration Method

## ✔ What it does

 Runs a callback on each element.
 Does not return anything.
 Used only for side effects (logging, updating DOM, etc.)

## ✔ Use-case

Best when you are:

 Printing values
 Updating UI
 Pushing into an external array
 Running functions without needing a return

## ✔ Syntax

```js
array.forEach((value, index, array) => {
    // perform action
});
```

## ✔ Example

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach(n => console.log(n));
// prints: 1 2 3
```

## ✔ Key Points

 Returns undefined.
 Not chainable like map/filter/reduce.
 Not meant for transformations.
