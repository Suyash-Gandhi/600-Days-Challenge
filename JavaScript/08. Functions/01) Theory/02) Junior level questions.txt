Q1. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?

Ans ⇒

The main differences lie in how they are defined, hoisting behavior, and usage flexibility.

1. Function Declaration

 A function declaration defines a named function using a standard syntax.
 It is hoisted completely, meaning it can be called before it is defined in the code.
 Commonly used for utility functions or core logic that should be accessible throughout the scope.

Key characteristics:

 Hoisted (available before definition)
 Must have a name
 More readable for large programs

---

2. Function Expression

 A function expression assigns a function to a variable.
 It is not hoisted as a function, only the variable is hoisted (without value).
 The function can be anonymous or named.
 Often used in callbacks, closures, and conditional logic.

Key characteristics:

 Not hoisted like declarations
 More flexible
 Useful for dynamic or conditional execution

---

Summary Difference

| Aspect        | Function Declaration | Function Expression      |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Hoisting      | Yes (fully)          | No                       |
| Name required | Yes                  | No (can be anonymous)    |
| Usage         | General-purpose      | Callbacks, dynamic logic |

Q2. Explain the difference between parameters and arguments in a function.

Ans ⇒

Parameters and arguments are related but refer to different stages of function execution.

1. Parameters

 Parameters are variables listed in the function definition.
 They act as placeholders to receive values when the function is called.
 Defined at function creation time.

Example explanation:
When you define a function and specify inputs, those inputs are parameters.

---

2. Arguments

 Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is invoked.
 Supplied at function call time.
 These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters.

---

Key Difference

| Aspect       | Parameters          | Arguments     |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Defined when | Function definition | Function call |
| Nature       | Variables           | Actual values |
| Purpose      | Receive data        | Provide data  |

---

Q3. What happens if you call a function with fewer arguments than parameters?

Ans ⇒

JavaScript does not throw an error when a function is called with fewer arguments.

What actually happens

 Missing arguments are automatically assigned the value `undefined`.
 The corresponding parameters receive `undefined`.
 The function still executes normally.

Implications

 Operations using those parameters may produce unexpected results.
 This can lead to logical bugs if not handled properly.
 Developers often use:

   Default values
   Conditional checks
    to avoid issues.

Important Point

JavaScript functions are lenient, meaning:

 Fewer arguments → missing values become `undefined`
 More arguments → extra values are ignored unless accessed explicitly


Q4. What is the difference between a `return` statement and `console.log` inside a function?

Ans ⇒

Although both are used inside functions, they serve very different purposes.

1. `return` statement

 Sends a value back to the place where the function was called.
 Stops function execution immediately.
 Allows the returned value to be stored, reused, or passed to other logic.

Example idea:
A function that calculates a result must use `return` so the result can be used elsewhere.

---

2. `console.log()`

 Only prints output to the console for debugging or visibility.
 Does not return any value.
 Function execution continues after `console.log`.

---

Key Differences

| Aspect             | `return`         | `console.log`       |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Purpose            | Sends value back | Displays value      |
| Stops function     | Yes              | No                  |
| Value usable later | Yes              | No                  |
| Used in logic      | Yes              | No (debugging only) |

---

Important takeaway

> `console.log` is for developers, `return` is for program logic.

---

Q5. Explain what default parameters are with an example.

Ans ⇒

Default parameters

 Default parameters allow a function parameter to have a predefined value.
 If no argument (or `undefined`) is passed, the default value is used.
 Introduced to avoid manual checks inside functions.

---

Why they are useful

 Prevent `undefined` values
 Make functions safer and cleaner
 Improve readability

---

Example

```js
const greet = (name = "Guest") => {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
};
```

 If no argument is passed → `"Guest"` is used
 If an argument is passed → that value overrides the default

---

Key Point

> Default parameters activate only when the argument is missing or `undefined`.

---

Q6. What does the keyword `this` inside a function refer to (in non-strict mode)?

Ans ⇒

In non-strict mode, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called.

1. Regular function call

 `this` refers to the global object.
 In browsers, this is the `window` object.

---

2. Method call (function inside an object)

 `this` refers to the object that owns the method.

---

Important Notes

 In non-strict mode, `this` never becomes `undefined`.
 If context is missing, JavaScript defaults to the global object.

---

One-line summary

> In non-strict mode, `this` points to the caller, and defaults to the global object if no explicit context exists.

---

Q7. What is the difference between regular functions and arrow functions?

Ans ⇒

Regular functions and arrow functions differ mainly in syntax, behavior of `this`, and flexibility.

---

1. Regular Functions

 Have their own `this` context.
 Can be used as constructors.
 Support `arguments` object.
 Suitable for object methods.

---

2. Arrow Functions

 Do not have their own `this`.
 `this` is lexically inherited from the surrounding scope.
 Cannot be used as constructors.
 No `arguments` object.

---

Comparison Table

| Feature         | Regular Function | Arrow Function  |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `this` binding  | Dynamic          | Lexical         |
| Constructor use | Yes              | No              |
| `arguments`     | Available        | Not available   |
| Syntax          | Verbose          | Short & concise |

---

When to use what

 Use regular functions for object methods and constructors
 Use arrow functions for callbacks and functional-style code
