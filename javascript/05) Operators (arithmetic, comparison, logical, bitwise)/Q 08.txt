Q8. What will "2" > "12" evaluate to? Explain string comparison 
rules.

Answer:

"2" > "12" evaluates to true.

Explanation (step by step):

Both operands are strings.
JavaScript uses lexicographical (dictionary-like) comparison 
when both operands are strings. This means it compares 
character by character from left to right, based on Unicode 
code points.

Compare the first characters:

"2" → first character is '2' (Unicode code point 50)

"12" → first character is '1' (Unicode code point 49)

Lexicographical rule:

Compare '2' vs '1' → '2' > '1' → true

Since the first character already determines the comparison, 
the remaining characters are ignored.

Key point:

Strings are compared character by character, not by numeric 
value.

"2" (as string) is greater than "12" (as string) even though 
numerically 2 < 12.

Takeaway:
Always convert strings to numbers if you want numeric 
comparison:

Number("2") > Number("12")  // false
