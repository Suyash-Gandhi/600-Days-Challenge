Q1. Explain the difference between ++i and i++ with an example.

=> Difference between ++i and i++
1. Definition

++i (Pre-increment): Increments the value of i first, then 
returns the updated value.

i++ (Post-increment): Returns the current value of i first, 
then increments it afterwards.

2. Working Mechanism

Pre-increment (++i):

Increase the value of the variable immediately.

Use the new (incremented) value in the expression.

Post-increment (i++):

Use the current (old) value of the variable in the expression.

Increment happens after the value is used.

3. Code Example
let a = 5;
let b = ++a;  // pre-increment
console.log(a, b); // Output: 6, 6

let x = 5;
let y = x++;  // post-increment
console.log(x, y); // Output: 6, 5

4. Explanation of Example

Pre-increment (++a)

a is first increased from 5 â†’ 6.

Then b takes the updated value 6.

So, both a and b are 6.

Post-increment (x++)

y first takes the current value of x (5).

Then x is incremented to 6.

So, x = 6 but y = 5.
