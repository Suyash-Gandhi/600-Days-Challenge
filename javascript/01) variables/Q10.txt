Q10. What is the difference between global variables in 
browsers and Node.js?

In Browsers → the global object is window (or self in Web Workers).
Every global variable declared with var (outside any function) 
automatically becomes a property of the window object.

In browsers, a top-level variable declared with var is 
both global scope and attached to window.

var x = 10;
console.log(window.x); // 10

In Node.js → the global object is global, not window.
However, variables declared with var, let, or const at the top 
level do not become properties of global.

In Node.js, top-level variables are actually scoped to the 
module, not the global object.

var x = 10;
console.log(global.x); // undefined
