//Q4. Write a for...of loop to print all the values in an array.


const arr=[1,2,3,4,5]

for (const val of arr) {
    console.log(val);
    
}


/*
The for...of loop in JavaScript is specifically used for 
iterating over values of iterable objects such as arrays, strings, Maps, 
Sets, and other objects that implement the iterable protocol.

It is not used for plain objects (you would use for...in for 
object keys instead).
