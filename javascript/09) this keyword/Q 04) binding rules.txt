# 🔷 The `this` Keyword in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called, not where it is defined.
This makes `this` dynamic, and its behavior is controlled by binding rules — the rules that decide what `this` points to at runtime.

There are four primary binding rules:

1. Default Binding
2. Implicit Binding
3. Explicit Binding
4. New Binding

Let’s explain each one step by step.

---

## 🟢 1. Default Binding

### 🔹 Concept:

When a function is called without any context (no object before it), the `this` keyword defaults to the global object (in browsers: `window`, in Node.js: `global`) — unless in strict mode, where it becomes `undefined`.

### 🔹 Example:

```js
function showName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

var name = "Suyash";
showName(); // "Suyash" in non-strict mode, error or undefined in strict mode
```

### 🔹 Explanation:

 Since the function is called directly (`showName()`), it’s not attached to any object.
 Hence, default binding applies.
 In non-strict mode, `this` → `window` (or `global`).
 In strict mode, `this` → `undefined`.

### 🔹 Summary:

| Mode       | `this` refers to                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Non-strict | Global object (`window` / `global`) |
| Strict     | `undefined`                         |

## 🟠 2. Implicit Binding

### 🔹 Concept:

When a function is called as a method of an object, the `this` keyword is implicitly bound to the object that owns the method.

### 🔹 Example:

```js
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

user.greet(); // "Alice"
```

### 🔹 Explanation:

 Here, `greet()` is called as a property of `user`.
 Therefore, `this` automatically binds to the object before the dot (`user`).

### ⚠️ Important Note:

If you assign the method to another variable and call it separately, implicit binding is lost.

```js
const greetFn = user.greet;
greetFn(); // undefined or error (default binding applies)
```

So, implicit binding only works when the function is called directly via an object reference.

---

## 🔵 3. Explicit Binding

### 🔹 Concept:

You can manually control what `this` refers to using the built-in functions:

 `call()`
 `apply()`
 `bind()`

These are methods available on every function that let you explicitly specify the `this` value.

---

### 🔹 Example with `call()`:

```js
function show() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const obj = { name: "Bob" };

show.call(obj); // "Bob"
```

Here, `this` is explicitly bound to `obj`.

---

### 🔹 `apply()` example:

Similar to `call()`, except arguments are passed as an array.

```js
function introduce(lang1, lang2) {
  console.log(`${this.name} knows ${lang1} and ${lang2}`);
}

const dev = { name: "Eve" };
introduce.apply(dev, ["JavaScript", "Python"]); 
// Eve knows JavaScript and Python
```

---

### 🔹 `bind()` example:

Creates a new function that remembers the `this` value.

```js
function greet() {
  console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`);
}

const person = { name: "Charlie" };
const greetCharlie = greet.bind(person);
greetCharlie(); // Hello Charlie
```

`bind()` does not immediately call the function — it returns a new function with `this` permanently set.

---

## 🔴 4. New Binding

### 🔹 Concept:

When a function is called with the `new` keyword, JavaScript automatically does the following steps:

1. Creates a new empty object.
2. Sets the new object’s prototype to the function’s `prototype` property.
3. Binds `this` to the new object.
4. Returns the new object automatically (unless the function explicitly returns another object).

### 🔹 Example:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const p1 = new Person("David");
console.log(p1.name); // "David"
```

### 🔹 Explanation:

 The `new` keyword created a new empty object.
 Inside the function, `this` points to that new object.
 After execution, the new object (`p1`) is returned.

# ⚖️ Precedence Order of Binding Rules

When multiple rules could apply, JavaScript decides based on priority:

| Precedence | Binding Type         | Example                            |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣        | New binding      | `new Foo()`                        |
| 2️⃣        | Explicit binding | `foo.call(obj)` or `foo.bind(obj)` |
| 3️⃣        | Implicit binding | `obj.foo()`                        |
| 4️⃣        | Default binding  | `foo()`                            |

Higher rules override lower ones.

# 🧠 Example to Illustrate All Four Bindings

```js
function sayName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const obj1 = { name: "Alice", sayName };
const obj2 = { name: "Bob" };

// Default binding
sayName(); // undefined or window.name

// Implicit binding
obj1.sayName(); // Alice

// Explicit binding
sayName.call(obj2); // Bob

// New binding
const p = new sayName(); // Creates a new object, this → p (empty object)
```

# 🏁 Summary Table

| Binding Type         | How It Happens                   | `this` Refers To             | Example         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Default Binding      | Simple function call             | Global object / undefined    | `foo()`         |
| Implicit Binding     | Called through object            | That object                  | `obj.foo()`     |
| Explicit Binding     | Using `call`, `apply`, or `bind` | The explicitly passed object | `foo.call(obj)` |
| New Binding          | Called with `new` keyword        | The newly created object     | `new Foo()`     |

✅ In short:

 “`this` is not about where a function is defined — it’s about how it’s called.”
