Q4. Explain the difference between function scope and block scope in JavaScript

=> 1. Function Scope

A variable has function scope when it is accessible only 
inside the function where it was declared.
Variables declared with var are function-scoped.
They are not restricted by { } blocks like if, for, or while.

2. Block Scope

A variable has block scope when it is accessible only inside 
the nearest { } block (if, for, while, etc.).
Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped.
