Q9. What happens if two variables with the same name are 
declaredâ€”one with var inside a function and one with let 
outside the function?

=> var is function scopeed and let is blocked scope, 
that means inside a function var will shadow global/block let

let x = 100;   // declared in global (or outer block) scope

function test() {
  var x = 200; // declared inside function scope
  console.log(x); // logs 200
}

test();
console.log(x);   // logs 100

What happens here:

let x = 100;

A block/global-scoped variable x is created.

Inside test(), var x = 200;

A different x is created, local to the function.

It shadows the outer x only inside the function.

console.log(x) inside test() prints 200 (local var).

console.log(x) outside prints 100 (outer let).
