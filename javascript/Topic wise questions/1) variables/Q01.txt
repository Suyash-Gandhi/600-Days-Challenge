Q1. What are the differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

=> let: Only work inside the { } block where you wrote it. 
Cannot be used before declaring. you can change its value but 
cannot redeclare. Use let when you know the value will change.

const: Only work inside the { } block where you wrote it.
Cannot be used before declaring. you cannot change its value. 
Use const by default; only use let when you need to reassign.

var: It is accessible throughout the function in which it is 
declared. If declared outside a function, it becomes globally
scoped. It can be used before declaring but shows undefined. 
Avoid var unless maintaining legacy code
