Q2. How does JavaScript differentiate between primitive types 
and reference types?

=> 1. Primitive Types

These are immutable (cannot be changed once created).

Stored directly in the stack memory.

Compared by value.

2. Reference Types

These are mutable (can be changed after creation).

Stored in heap memory, while the stack stores a reference to the object.

Compared by reference (memory location), not by value
