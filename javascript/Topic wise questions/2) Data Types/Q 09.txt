Q9. Explain the difference between object and array in terms 
of data type and usage

=> Objects in JavaScript

Data type:
Objects are a reference type in JavaScript.
They store data in keyâ€“value pairs.

Usage:

Best when you want to represent entities with properties.

Keys are usually strings (or symbols).

Values can be any type (primitive or reference).

Example:

const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
};
console.log(person.name); // "Alice"


Here, person is an object with descriptive properties.

Arrays in JavaScript

Data type:
Arrays are a special kind of object designed for ordered 
collections.
Technically, typeof [] returns "object", but arrays have extra 
methods/properties like .length, .push(), .map().

Usage:

Best when you want a list of items in order.

Elements are indexed with numbers starting from 0.

Often used for iteration and bulk data operations.

Example:

const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
console.log(numbers[1]); // 20
numbers.push(40);
console.log(numbers); // [10, 20, 30, 40]
