Q3. Difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

=> 1. Null

Represents the intentional absence of any value. You explicitly
 assign null to a variable. It is of object type (this is a 
 historical JavaScript quirk)

 2. undefined
 
 Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned 
 a value or a function that doesnâ€™t return anything. This is of
 type undefined
