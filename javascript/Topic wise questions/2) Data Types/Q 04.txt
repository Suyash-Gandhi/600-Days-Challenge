Q4. Explain the difference between symbol and string data types.
When would you use a symbol?

=> 1. String

Represents a sequence of characters (text). Strings are 
immutable and can have identical values. They are commonly
used for messages, object keys, or any textual data.
Two strings can be identical. "id" === "id" → true.

2. Symbol

Represents a unique and immutable identifier. Every Symbol is 
guaranteed to be unique, even if it has the same description. 
Symbol("id") === Symbol("id") → false.. 
Symbols are mainly used as unique object keys or for defining 
internal/private properties. Primarily used as unique keys in 
objects, to avoid property name collisions.


When to use a Symbol

Unique object keys to prevent name clashes:

const id = Symbol("id");
const user = {};
user[id] = 123;
console.log(user); // { [Symbol(id)]: 123 }


Defining private or internal properties that shouldn’t be 
accidentally accessed or overwritten.

Implementing well-known symbols like Symbol.iterator for 
custom iteration behavior.
