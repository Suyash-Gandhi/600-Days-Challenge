# Basic Networking for Attackers (IP, TCP/UDP, DNS, Routing)

To understand cybersecurity from an attacker’s perspective, networking is the most important foundation. Attackers exploit how data travels across networks, how devices communicate, and how protocols are structured. Four core concepts—IP addressing, TCP/UDP, DNS, and routing—form the base of almost all attacks.

---

# 1. IP (Internet Protocol)

IP is the fundamental addressing system of the internet.

## 1.1. What IP Does

 Identifies each device on a network using an IP address
 Delivers packets from source → destination
 Supports fragmentation and reassembly

## 1.2. IPv4 Structure

Example: 192.168.1.10

 32-bit address
 Divided into network part + host part
 Usually represented in CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24

## 1.3. Why IP Matters to Attackers

Attackers analyze and manipulate IP addressing to:

 Identify targets during reconnaissance
 Scan subnets (Nmap)
 Spoof IP addresses

   Used in DDoS, reflection attacks, evasion
 Bypass network ACLs/firewalls
 Map internal network ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16)

## 1.4. Common IP-Based Attack Techniques

 IP Spoofing
  Send packets with a forged source IP to hide identity.
 Subnet Scanning
  Sweep networks using ping scans or SYN scans.
 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
  Intercept packets via ARP poisoning or rogue AP.

# 2. TCP & UDP Protocols

These are the core transport-layer protocols that manage communication between systems.

---

## 2.1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

A connection-oriented, reliable protocol.

### Key Features

 3-way handshake: SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK
 Guaranteed delivery, sequencing, error detection
 Used by HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP

### Why TCP Matters to Attackers

Attackers study TCP for:

 Port scanning (SYN scan, ACK scan, FIN scan)
 Session hijacking
  Predicting sequence numbers to inject packets.
 Firewall evasion
  Using fragmented TCP packets to bypass rules.
 SYN Flood attacks
  Overloading servers with half-open connections.

---

## 2.2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

A connectionless, fast protocol.

### Key Features

 No handshake
 No reliability
 Used by DNS, VoIP, gaming, streaming

### Attacker Use Cases

 UDP Flooding for DDoS
 Exploiting DNS amplification
 Scanning UDP ports for services (SNMP, TFTP, NTP)

---

## 2.3. TCP vs UDP (Attacker Perspective)

| Feature     | TCP                                 | UDP                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Reliability | High                                | None                              |
| Speed       | Slower                              | Faster                            |
| Attacks     | SYN Flood, RST injection, Hijacking | Amplification attacks, UDP floods |
| Scanning    | SYN scan                            | UDP scan                          |

# 3. DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS translates human-readable domains into IP addresses.

---

## 3.1. How DNS Works

When a user types google.com:

1. Query goes to resolver
2. Then to root server
3. Then TLD server (.com)
4. Then authoritative server
5. Returns IP address (e.g., 142.250.182.142)

---

## 3.2. Why DNS Matters to Attackers

DNS is one of the most abused protocols.

### Attacker Techniques Using DNS

 DNS Spoofing / Poisoning

   Trick user into visiting malicious IP
 DNS Tunneling

   Use DNS queries to bypass firewalls and exfiltrate data
 Subdomain enumeration

   Find hidden services using tools like dnsrecon, amass
 DNS Amplification DDoS

   Attackers send spoofed requests to DNS servers, causing huge response traffic

### DNS Record Types Attackers Care About

 A – IPv4 address
 AAAA – IPv6 address
 MX – mail server (target phishing attacks)
 TXT – can contain API keys/misconfig
 PTR – reverse lookup
 NS – nameservers

---

# 4. Routing (How Packets Travel)

Routing determines how packets travel from source to destination across networks.

---

## 4.1. Types of Routers

1. Home/Small Office Routers
2. Enterprise Routers / Firewalls
3. ISP Backbone Routers

---

## 4.2. How Routing Works

Routers use routing tables to forward packets.

Table contains:

 Destination network
 Next hop
 Interface

Routing protocols:

 RIP (distance vector)
 OSPF (link-state)
 BGP (internet-scale)

---

## 4.3. Why Routing Is Important for Attackers

### 4.3.1. MITM Attacks

Attacker manipulates routing to intercept traffic:

 ARP Spoofing
 DHCP Spoofing
 Rogue gateway attacks
 BGP hijacking (internet-level MITM)

### 4.3.2. Route Manipulation

Changing packet paths to:

 Bypass security devices
 Reroute users to malicious servers
 Drop or modify traffic

### 4.3.3. Internal Network Pivoting

Attackers use routing knowledge to:

 Move laterally inside networks
 Access hidden subnets (pivoting with proxies or SSH tunnels)

---

# 5. Putting It All Together (Attacker Workflow Example)

A typical attacker uses all four fundamentals together:

### Step 1: IP Recon

Find live hosts in network 192.168.1.0/24.

### Step 2: TCP/UDP Scan

 Discover open ports
 Identify services (SSH, HTTP, DNS, SNMP)

### Step 3: DNS Enumeration

Find subdomains:

 admin.example.com
 dev.example.com

### Step 4: Exploit Routing Weakness

Perform ARP poisoning → capture traffic → steal credentials.

Everything an attacker does depends on this networking base.

---

# 6. Why This Knowledge Is Essential for Attackers

Cyber attacks succeed when the attacker knows the network better than the defender.
These fundamentals allow attackers to:

 Map networks
 Find vulnerabilities
 Intercept traffic
 Exploit weak configurations
 Evade detection
 Move across systems

This is why every cybersecurity syllabus begins with networking.
