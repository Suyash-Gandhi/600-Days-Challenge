Below is a clean, complete, university-style explanation of AES, RSA, and TLS — what they are, how they work, why they’re used, and how they connect to the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

# 1. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

### What It Is

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.

### Purpose

Used to protect Confidentiality of data.

### Where It Is Used

 Wi-Fi security (WPA2/WPA3)
 Disk encryption (BitLocker, FileVault)
 Secure messaging apps
 Database encryption

### How It Works (Simple Explanation)

 You have one secret key.
 You use this key to turn readable data → ciphertext (unreadable).
 The same key is used to convert ciphertext → original data.

### Why AES Is Trusted

 Extremely fast
 Strong security
 Used worldwide as a standard

### Key Sizes

AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
Higher key size → stronger security.

# 2. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

### What It Is

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, meaning it uses two keys:

 Public key → used to encrypt
 Private key → used to decrypt

### Purpose

Used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and Confidentiality + Integrity.

### Where It Is Used

 SSL/TLS certificates
 Signing software (e.g., verifying Windows updates)
 Blockchain wallets (private/public key pairs)
 Email encryption (PGP)

### How It Works (Conceptually)

 Generate a public key (you share this with anyone)
 Generate a private key (only you keep this)
 Anyone can encrypt a message with your public key
 Only your private key can decrypt it

### Why RSA Is Important

It solves a key problem:
How can two strangers share a secret key securely over the internet?

# 3. TLS (Transport Layer Security)

### What It Is

TLS is not an encryption algorithm.
It is a security protocol used to secure communication between two devices over the internet.

### Purpose

Protects:

 Confidentiality (encryption)
 Integrity (no tampering)
 Authentication (ensures you’re talking to the real website)

### Where It Is Used

 HTTPS websites
 Secure email
 Online banking
 Apps that communicate over the internet

### How TLS Works (Step-by-Step)

1. Client connects to server
2. Server shows a digital certificate (contains RSA/ECDSA public key)
3. Client verifies the server’s identity
4. Client and server use RSA/ECDHE to exchange a secret key
5. That key is used to create a secure encrypted tunnel
6. Inside the tunnel, fast algorithms like AES encrypt all data

So TLS = RSA/ECDHE (key exchange) + AES (data encryption) + HMAC (integrity)

### Example

When you visit [https://google.com](https://google.com):

 Browser checks Google’s certificate
 Browser and Google generate a shared secret over RSA/ECDHE
 All communication (search results, login details) is encrypted with AES

# How They All Fit Together

| Technology | Type                  | Purpose                  | Used In                |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| AES    | Symmetric encryption  | Encrypt data fast        | Wi-Fi, storage, TLS    |
| RSA    | Asymmetric encryption | Key exchange, signatures | Certs, TLS, blockchain |
| TLS    | Security protocol     | Secure communication     | HTTPS, banking, apps   |
