# TLS vs SSL — What Are They? Why Are They Important?

## 1. Introduction

When you visit a secure website (HTTPS), your browser and the server must ensure:

 Confidentiality → no one can read your data
 Integrity → no one can modify your data
 Authentication → confirm you’re talking to the real server

To achieve this, the internet uses cryptographic protocols called SSL and TLS.

# 2. What is SSL? (Secure Sockets Layer)

SSL is the older security protocol created by Netscape in the 1990s.

### SSL Versions:

 SSL 1.0 → never released
 SSL 2.0 → insecure
 SSL 3.0 → broken (POODLE attack)

### Why SSL is no longer used?

SSL has many vulnerabilities:

 Weak ciphers
 Weak key exchange
 Protocol flaws (e.g., POODLE, DROWN)
 Not secure for modern internet traffic

### Final verdict:

> SSL is dead and deprecated.

Modern browsers disable SSL entirely.

# 3. What is TLS? (Transport Layer Security)

TLS is the successor of SSL.
It fixes SSL’s flaws and provides modern, strong security.

### TLS Versions:

 TLS 1.0 → 1999 (old)
 TLS 1.1 → 2006 (old)
 TLS 1.2 → 2008 (VERY widely used, still strong)
 TLS 1.3 → 2018 (modern, faster, more secure)

Most secure websites today use:

✔ TLS 1.2
✔ TLS 1.3

# 4. TLS vs SSL: The Key Differences

| Feature       | SSL              | TLS                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Security      | Weak / broken    | Strong & modern                           |
| Status        | Deprecated       | Active, used everywhere                   |
| Speed         | Slow handshake   | Faster handshake                          |
| Cipher suites | Weak (RC4, 3DES) | Strong (AES-GCM, ChaCha20)                |
| Key exchange  | Often RSA        | Always ECDHE (forward secrecy) in TLS 1.3 |
| Versions      | SSL 2/3          | TLS 1.0–1.3                               |

# 5. Why the industry moved from SSL to TLS?

### 1. SSL has critical vulnerabilities

 POODLE
 DROWN
 BEAST
 Heartbleed (affects older implementations)

### 2. TLS offers stronger algorithms

 AES-GCM
 ChaCha20
 SHA-256/384
 ECDHE key exchange

### 3. TLS 1.3 is much faster

 Fewer handshake steps
 Better performance for HTTPS websites

---

# 6. Do we still say “SSL certificate”?

Yes—but it’s technically incorrect.

The industry still uses terms like:

 “SSL certificate”
 “SSL/TLS”
 “SSL secured website”

But these certificates are used by TLS, NOT SSL.

---

# 7. Real-World Example (HTTPS)

When you open:

```
https://google.com
```

Your browser does:

1. Start TLS handshake
2. Verify Google’s certificate
3. Perform ECDHE key exchange
4. Create secure symmetric key (AES-GCM)
5. Begin encrypted communication

SSL is not used at all.

---

# 8. Attacker Perspective (Why You Must Know This)

Attackers try to downgrade the connection from:

 TLS → SSL
 TLS 1.3 → TLS 1.0

Weak protocols allow:

 MITM attacks
 Cipher downgrade attacks
 Decryption of traffic
 Session hijacking

This is why servers disable:

 SSL 2.0
 SSL 3.0
 TLS 1.0
 TLS 1.1

Modern sites only support:

 TLS 1.2
 TLS 1.3

---

# 9. Summary (Easy to Remember)

### SSL

 Old
 Insecure
 Deprecated
 Never used today

### TLS

 Modern
 Secure
 Used in HTTPS
 Supports strong encryption
 Powers almost all secure communication today
