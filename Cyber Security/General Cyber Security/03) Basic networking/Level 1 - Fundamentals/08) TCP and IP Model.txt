# TCP/IP Model – Full Explanation (Cybersecurity & Attacker Perspective)

The TCP/IP Model, also known as the Internet Protocol Suite, is the real-world model used for all networking and internet communication. While the OSI Model is theoretical (7 layers), TCP/IP is practical (4 layers).

The goal of this model is simple:
Define how data should be packaged, transported, addressed, transmitted, and routed across networks such as the internet.

It forms the foundation for:

 Ethical hacking
 Network pentesting
 Packet crafting
 Exploitation
 Traffic interception
 DDoS attacks
 VPNs, firewalls, and routers

Understanding the TCP/IP model is essential for modern cybersecurity.

# 📌 Overview of TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)

| TCP/IP Layer              | Equivalent OSI Layers | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Application           | OSI 5, 6, 7           | Network apps & protocols               |
| Transport             | OSI 4                 | End-to-end delivery (TCP/UDP)          |
| Internet              | OSI 3                 | IP addressing & routing                |
| Network Access / Link | OSI 1 & 2             | Physical transmission on local network |

---

# ⭐ Layer 1: Network Access Layer (Link Layer)

(Combines OSI Layer 1 + 2)
This is the foundation of communication inside a local network.

---

## 1.1 Responsibilities

 Defines how data is physically transmitted
 Handles frame creation and detection
 Deals with MAC addresses
 Provides hardware-level communication
 Performs ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
 Creates frames for network travel

---

## 1.2 Examples

 Ethernet
 Wi-Fi
 ARP (MAC ↔ IP resolution)
 PPP
 Switches, NICs

---

## 1.3 Attacker Viewpoint

The Link Layer is heavily targeted in local network hacking.

### Key Attacks

 ARP Spoofing / Poisoning
  Redirects traffic to attacker → MITM
 MAC Address Spoofing
  Hide identity on LAN
 DHCP Spoofing
  Redirect victims to attacker DNS/gateway
 Packet sniffing
  Using Wireshark/tcpdump on same LAN
 Rogue Access Points
  Fake Wi-Fi networks for interception

---

## 1.4 Why Attackers Must Understand This Layer

Because all LAN attacks (MITM, sniffing, spoofing) depend on how frames travel inside a network.

---

# ⭐ Layer 2: Internet Layer

(Equivalent to OSI Layer 3 – Network Layer)

This is the heart of the TCP/IP model. It enables devices to communicate across networks by providing IP addressing and routing.

---

## 2.1 Responsibilities

 Logical addressing (IP addresses)
 Routing packets across networks
 Fragmentation/reassembly
 Determining best path via routers

---

## 2.2 Key Protocols

 IP (IPv4 / IPv6)
 ICMP (ping, traceroute)
 IGMP (multicast)
 Routing protocols (BGP, OSPF, RIP)

---

## 2.3 Attacker Viewpoint

Most reconnaissance and DDoS attacks happen here.

### Common Attacks

 IP Spoofing
  Used in DDoS, evasion
 ICMP Attacks
  Ping flood, smurf attacks
 Route manipulation
  Traffic redirection
 BGP Hijacking
  Modify internet routing → massive MITM
 Subnet scanning
  Mapping networks via Nmap

---

## 2.4 Importance for Attackers

This is where attackers learn how to:

 Scan networks
 Map targets
 Evade firewalls
 Perform DDoS

---

# ⭐ Layer 3: Transport Layer

(Equivalent to OSI Layer 4 – Transport Layer)

This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control.

---

## 3.1 Responsibilities

 Breaks data into segments
 Sends data from one application to another
 Ensures reliability or speed (TCP vs UDP)
 Uses ports (0–65535) to identify services

---

## 3.2 Key Protocols

 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

---

## 3.3 TCP Explained

 Connection-oriented (“phone call”)
 Reliable
 Uses 3-way handshake (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK)
 Guarantees ordered delivery

---

## 3.4 UDP Explained

 Connectionless (“sending a postcard”)
 Unreliable
 Very fast
 Used in DNS, gaming, VoIP

---

## 3.5 Attacker Viewpoint

### TCP Attacks

 SYN Flood (DDoS)
  Send massive SYNs without completing handshake
 TCP Session Hijacking
  Predict sequence numbers
 Reset (RST) injection
  Kill connections
 Ack scan, FIN scan, Xmas scan (Nmap evasion)

### UDP Attacks

 UDP Floods
 Amplification attacks (DNS, NTP, SSDP)

### Port-Based Attacks

Attackers scan:

 HTTP (80/443)
 SSH (22)
 FTP (21)
 MySQL (3306)
 RDP (3389)

Transport layer is central to vulnerability scanning.

---

# ⭐ Layer 4: Application Layer

(Equivalent to OSI Layers 5, 6, 7 combined)

This layer directly interacts with user applications and network services.

---

## 4.1 Responsibilities

 High-level protocols like HTTP, DNS
 User authentication
 Data formatting, encryption (TLS)
 File transfer, email, web content

---

## 4.2 Key Protocols

 HTTP / HTTPS
 DNS
 SMTP / IMAP / POP3
 FTP / SFTP
 SSH / Telnet
 DHCP

---

## 4.3 Attacker Viewpoint

Most modern hacking occurs at this layer.

### Web Attacks

 SQL Injection
 XSS
 File Upload Exploits
 CSRF
 Command Injection
 Broken authentication

### DNS Attacks

 DNS Spoofing
 DNS Tunneling
 Subdomain enumeration
 Amplification DDoS

### Email Attacks

 Phishing
 Business Email Compromise
 SMTP open relay abuse

### Authentication Attacks

 Brute forcing
 Credential stuffing
 Weak session tokens

# ⭐ Why TCP/IP Model Matters for Cybersecurity

The TCP/IP model allows attackers and defenders to:

 Understand where vulnerabilities exist
 Trace packet flow and identify weak points
 Craft packets for attacks (scapy, hping3)
 Simulate DDoS attacks
 Perform MITM by manipulating layers
 Understand how firewalls, routers, and VPNs work
 Analyze network logs and packet captures

Every attack can be mapped to at least one layer of the TCP/IP model.
