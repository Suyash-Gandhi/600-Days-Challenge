### Definition

Ternary Search is a divide-and-conquer searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array (or to locate the maximum/minimum of a unimodal function).
Instead of dividing the search space into two parts (like Binary Search), it divides it into three parts using two mid points.

## How Ternary Search Works (Array Version)

Assume we are searching for a value `x` in a sorted array between indices `low` and `high`.

1. Calculate two mid points

    `mid1 = low + (high - low) / 3`
    `mid2 = high - (high - low) / 3`

2. Compare the target with mid elements

    If `arr[mid1] == x` → element found
    Else if `arr[mid2] == x` → element found

3. Reduce the search space

    If `x < arr[mid1]` → search in left one-third
    If `x > arr[mid2]` → search in right one-third
    Otherwise → search in the middle one-third

4. Repeat until `low > high` or the element is found

## Why Ternary Search Works

 The array is sorted, so comparisons give directional information.
 Each step eliminates 2/3 of the search space, leaving only 1/3 to search further.
 This makes it a logarithmic-time algorithm.

## Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

 Best Case: `O(1)` (element found at mid)
 Average Case: `O(log₃ n)`
 Worst Case: `O(log₃ n)`

> Note:
> Although `log₃ n` is mathematically smaller than `log₂ n`, ternary search involves more comparisons, so it is usually slower than Binary Search in practice for arrays.

### Space Complexity

 Iterative version: `O(1)`
 Recursive version: `O(log n)` (due to recursion stack)

## Ternary Search vs Binary Search

| Feature              | Binary Search | Ternary Search  |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Array requirement    | Sorted        | Sorted          |
| Divisions            | 2             | 3               |
| Mid points           | 1             | 2               |
| Comparisons per step | Fewer         | More            |
| Practical speed      | Faster        | Slower          |
| Common usage         | Very common   | Rare for arrays |

✅ Conclusion:
For searching in arrays, Binary Search is preferred.

## Where Ternary Search Is Actually Useful

Ternary Search is most useful for unimodal functions, not arrays.

### Unimodal Function

A function that:

 First increases
 Reaches a single maximum or minimum
 Then decreases

### Applications

 Finding maximum/minimum of a unimodal function
 Optimization problems
 Competitive programming (math-heavy problems)

Example scenarios:

 Maximum profit curve
 Minimum distance problems
 Physics / optimization equations

## Key Takeaways

 Ternary Search divides the search space into three parts
 Works only on sorted arrays or unimodal functions
 Time complexity is logarithmic
 Not better than Binary Search for array searching
 Very powerful for optimization problems
