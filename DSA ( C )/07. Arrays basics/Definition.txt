## 7. Arrays – Basics (DSA)

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in Data Structures & Algorithms. Almost every advanced structure (strings, matrices, heaps, hash tables, graphs using adjacency matrices) is built on top of arrays, so mastering them is non-negotiable.

---

## 1. What is an Array?

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations, and accessed using an index.

📌 Key idea:

> One name → multiple values → fixed memory block

Example (conceptual):

```
Index:   0   1   2   3   4
Value: 10  20  30  40  50
```

---

## 2. Why Arrays Are Important

Arrays are important because they provide:

 Fast access to elements using index
 Efficient memory usage (no extra pointers like linked lists)
 Foundation for many algorithms (sorting, searching, DP)

Without arrays, concepts like binary search, sliding window, prefix sums, dynamic programming would not exist.

---

## 3. Array Declaration and Initialization (C)

### Declaration

```c
int arr[5];
```

### Initialization

```c
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

### Partial Initialization

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2};
// Remaining elements become 0
```

### Size Inference

```c
int arr[] = {5, 10, 15};  // Size = 3
```

---

## 4. Indexing in Arrays

 Array indexing starts from 0
 Last index = `size - 1`

Example:

```c
arr[0] → first element  
arr[4] → last element (for size 5)
```

⚠️ Accessing out of bounds (like `arr[5]`) causes undefined behavior

---

## 5. Memory Representation

Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.

If:

 `arr[0]` is at address `1000`
 `int` size = 4 bytes

Then:

```
arr[0] → 1000
arr[1] → 1004
arr[2] → 1008
```

📌 This is why:

```c
arr[i] = (arr + i)
```

---

## 6. Types of Arrays

### 1️⃣ One-Dimensional Array

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

Used for:

 Lists
 Scores
 Frequencies

---

### 2️⃣ Two-Dimensional Array (Matrix)

```c
int mat[2][3] = {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6}
};
```

Used for:

 Matrices
 Grids
 DP tables

---

### 3️⃣ Multi-Dimensional Arrays

```c
int arr[3][4][5];
```

Used rarely, but common in:

 3D DP
 Scientific computing

---

## 7. Basic Operations on Arrays

### 1. Traversal

Accessing each element once.

```c
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
```

⏱ Time Complexity: O(n)

---

### 2. Insertion

 At end → O(1)
 At beginning / middle → O(n) (shifting required)

---

### 3. Deletion

 Requires shifting elements
 Time Complexity: O(n)

---

### 4. Searching

 Linear Search → O(n)
 Binary Search (sorted array) → O(log n)

---

## 8. Advantages of Arrays

✅ Fast random access
✅ Simple and easy to use
✅ Cache-friendly (due to contiguous memory)
✅ Efficient for fixed-size data

---

## 9. Limitations of Arrays

❌ Fixed size (cannot grow dynamically in C)
❌ Insertion & deletion are costly
❌ Memory wastage if size is overestimated
❌ Homogeneous data only (same type)

These limitations lead to Linked Lists, Vectors, and Dynamic Arrays.

---

## 10. Common Mistakes Beginners Make

⚠️ Accessing out-of-bound index
⚠️ Forgetting array size during traversal
⚠️ Confusing index with value
⚠️ Assuming array size can change dynamically in C

---

## 11. Important Array Concepts for DSA (Must Know)

You should be comfortable with:

 Prefix sum arrays
 Sliding window technique
 Two-pointer technique
 Subarray problems
 Kadane’s Algorithm
 Array rotation
 Frequency arrays

---

## 12. Typical Interview Questions on Arrays

 Find the largest / smallest element
 Reverse an array
 Find duplicate elements
 Rotate array by K steps
 Maximum subarray sum
 Merge two sorted arrays

---

## 13. When to Use Arrays vs Others

| Scenario               | Best Choice            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Fixed-size data        | Array                  |
| Fast indexing          | Array                  |
| Frequent insert/delete | Linked List            |
| Dynamic resizing       | Vector / Dynamic Array |

---

## Summary

 Arrays store same-type elements in contiguous memory
 Provide O(1) access
 Poor at insertion/deletion
 Backbone of most DSA problems
