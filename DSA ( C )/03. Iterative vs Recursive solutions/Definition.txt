## 1. What is an Iterative Solution?

An iterative solution solves a problem by repeating a set of instructions using loops such as:

 `for`
 `while`
 `do-while`

### Key idea

➡️ The program controls repetition explicitly using loop conditions.

### Characteristics

 Uses loops
 Does not use function call stack repeatedly
 State (variables) is managed manually
 Usually faster and memory-efficient

### Example problems

 Traversing an array
 Calculating factorial using a loop
 Binary search (iterative version)

---

## 2. What is a Recursive Solution?

A recursive solution solves a problem by calling itself on a smaller input until a base condition is met.

### Key idea

➡️ A problem is broken into smaller sub-problems of the same type.

### Two mandatory parts of recursion

1. Base Case – stops recursion
2. Recursive Case – function calls itself

### Characteristics

 Uses function calls
 Relies on the call stack
 Code is often shorter and cleaner
 Risk of stack overflow if not handled properly

### Example problems

 Factorial
 Fibonacci
 Tree traversal (DFS)
 Divide & Conquer algorithms

## 3. Core Differences (Iterative vs Recursive)

| Aspect              | Iterative            | Recursive                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Approach            | Loop-based           | Function calls itself      |
| Memory Usage        | Low (constant space) | Higher (call stack)        |
| Speed               | Generally faster     | Slightly slower (overhead) |
| Readability         | Sometimes complex    | Often more elegant         |
| Stack Overflow Risk | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                      |
| Best for            | Simple repetition    | Hierarchical problems      |

## 4. Time & Space Complexity Comparison

### Time Complexity

 Same in most cases

   Example: factorial → `O(n)` for both

### Space Complexity

 Iterative: `O(1)` (constant extra space)
 Recursive: `O(n)` (call stack grows)

📌 Important insight
Even if time complexity is same, space complexity differs, which matters in interviews and real systems.

## 5. When to Use Iteration?

Use iteration when:

 Problem is linear
 Performance and memory are critical
 Input size can be very large
 Stack overflow must be avoided

✔ Example:

 Array traversal
 Simple counting problems
 Sliding window techniques

---

## 6. When to Use Recursion?

Use recursion when:

 Problem has self-similar structure
 Divide & Conquer is natural
 Code clarity is more important
 Problem involves trees or graphs

✔ Example:

 Tree traversal
 Merge sort, Quick sort
 Backtracking problems

---

## 7. Interview Perspective (Very Important)

### What interviewers expect

 You should understand both
 Be able to convert recursion → iteration
 Explain stack behavior clearly

### Common interview trick

> “Can you solve this recursively?
> Now do it iteratively.”

If you understand how recursion uses the stack, iteration becomes easier.

## 8. Key Takeaways

 Iteration = loop + efficiency
 Recursion = elegance + stack usage
 Same logic, different execution model
 Prefer recursion for trees & divide-and-conquer
 Prefer iteration for large inputs & performance
