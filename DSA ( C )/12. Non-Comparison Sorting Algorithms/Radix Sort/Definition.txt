### 1. What is Radix Sort?

Radix Sort is a non-comparison sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit, instead of comparing whole values.

It processes elements starting from:

 Least Significant Digit (LSD) → most common
  or
 Most Significant Digit (MSD) → used in some advanced variants

Radix Sort uses another stable sorting algorithm internally, most commonly Counting Sort.

### 2. Why is Radix Sort Non-Comparison?

 No direct element-to-element comparison (`<`, `>`)
 Ordering is based on digit positions
 Sorting is achieved using counting and grouping

Because of this, Radix Sort can achieve linear time complexity under suitable conditions.

---

### 3. Core Idea (How Radix Sort Thinks)

Instead of sorting numbers as a whole:

1. Sort by units digit
2. Then tens digit
3. Then hundreds digit
4. Continue until the highest digit

Each pass refines the order while keeping previous ordering intact (this is why stability is critical).

### 4. Step-by-Step Example (LSD Radix Sort)

#### Input

```
[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
```

---

#### Pass 1 – Sort by Units Digit

```
Digits: 0,5,5,0,2,4,2,6
Result: [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]
```

---

#### Pass 2 – Sort by Tens Digit

```
Digits: 7,9,0,0,2,4,7,6
Result: [802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]
```

---

#### Pass 3 – Sort by Hundreds Digit

```
Digits: 8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Result: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]
```

✅ Array is now fully sorted.

### 5. Why Stability Matters in Radix Sort

Radix Sort depends on stability because:

 Each digit pass must preserve the order from previous passes
 Unstable sorting would destroy earlier digit ordering

👉 That’s why Counting Sort is used internally.

---

### 6. Time and Space Complexity

| Aspect | Complexity         |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| Time   | O(d × (n + k)) |
| Space  | O(n + k)       |

Where:

 `n` = number of elements
 `d` = number of digits
 `k` = range of each digit (usually 0–9)

For fixed digit size (like integers), this becomes O(n).

---

### 7. Types of Radix Sort

#### 1. LSD Radix Sort

 Starts from least significant digit
 Easier to implement
 Most commonly used

#### 2. MSD Radix Sort

 Starts from most significant digit
 More complex
 Useful for strings and variable-length keys

---

### 8. When to Use Radix Sort

Use Radix Sort when:

 Data consists of integers or fixed-length strings
 Range of digits is limited
 Stability is required
 Very large datasets need fast sorting

---

### 9. Limitations / Drawbacks

❌ Not suitable when:

 Numbers have very large digit counts
 Data is floating-point (without transformation)
 Extra memory usage is unacceptable

---

### 10. Radix Sort vs Other Sorting Algorithms

| Feature          | Radix Sort         | Counting Sort | Quick Sort |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Comparison-based | ❌ No               | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes      |
| Time             | O(n)               | O(n + k)      | O(n log n) |
| Stable           | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No       |
| Data Type        | Integers / Strings | Integers      | Any        |
| Extra Space      | Moderate           | High          | Low        |

### 11. Real-World Applications

 Sorting large integer datasets
 Sorting IDs, phone numbers
 Lexicographical string sorting
 Used in databases and indexing systems
 Preprocessing in high-performance systems

---

### 12. Exam & Interview Key Points

 Radix Sort is digit-based
 Uses Counting Sort internally
 Stability is mandatory
 Linear time for fixed digit size
 Not truly in-place

---

### 13. One-Line Summary

> Radix Sort sorts data digit by digit using a stable internal sort, achieving linear time for fixed-size keys without element comparisons.
