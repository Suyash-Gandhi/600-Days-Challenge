## Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient searching technique used to find an element in a sorted array or list by repeatedly dividing the search space into halves.

---

### 1. Core Idea

Binary Search follows the principle of divide and conquer.

Instead of checking elements one by one (like Linear Search), it:

 Compares the target with the middle element
 Eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step

This drastic reduction makes Binary Search very fast.

---

### 2. Mandatory Condition (Very Important)

✅ Data must be sorted (ascending or descending)

If the data is not sorted, Binary Search will not work correctly.

---

### 3. Step-by-Step Working

Example array (sorted):
`[5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]`
Target element: `25`

Steps:

1. Find the middle element → `20`
2. Compare `25` with `20`

    `25 > 20` → search in right half
3. New middle → `30`
4. Compare `25` with `30`

    `25 < 30` → search in left half
5. New middle → `25`
6. Match found → search ends

---

### 4. How the Search Space Shrinks

At every step:

 First check → `n` elements
 Next → `n / 2`
 Next → `n / 4`
 Next → `n / 8`
 …

This halving continues until the element is found or the range becomes empty.

### 5. Time Complexity Analysis

| Case             | Explanation                        | Time         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Best Case    | Element is the middle              | O(1)     |
| Average Case | Element found after several splits | O(log n) |
| Worst Case   | Element not present                | O(log n) |

➡️ Much faster than Linear Search (O(n)).

---

### 6. Space Complexity

 Iterative Binary Search → O(1)
 Recursive Binary Search → O(log n) (due to recursion stack)

---

### 7. Advantages

 Very fast for large datasets
 Efficient searching with minimal comparisons
 Ideal for static, sorted data

---

### 8. Disadvantages

 Requires sorted data
 Sorting itself costs time if data is unsorted
 Not suitable for linked lists (no direct access to middle)

---

### 9. Binary Search vs Linear Search

| Feature         | Linear Search | Binary Search    |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Data order      | Any           | Must be sorted   |
| Time complexity | O(n)          | O(log n)         |
| Approach        | Sequential    | Divide & conquer |
| Large data      | Inefficient   | Highly efficient |

### 10. Real-Life Analogy

Searching a word in a dictionary:

 You open the middle page
 Decide left or right based on alphabet order
 Repeat until the word is found
  ➡️ This is exactly Binary Search

---

### 11. Common Mistakes Students Make

 Applying Binary Search on unsorted arrays ❌
 Incorrect mid calculation (overflow in some languages)
 Infinite loops due to wrong boundary updates

---

### 12. When to Use Binary Search

Use Binary Search when:

 Data is sorted
 Dataset is large
 Fast lookup is required
 Random access is possible (arrays)
