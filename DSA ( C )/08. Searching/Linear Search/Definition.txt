## Linear Search (Sequential Search)

Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm.
It works by checking each element one by one from the beginning of a list until the required element is found or the list ends.

---

### 1. Basic Idea

 Start from the first element
 Compare it with the target value
 If it matches → search ends
 If not → move to the next element
 Continue until:

   the element is found, or
   all elements are checked

---

### 2. Where Linear Search is Used

Linear Search is useful when:

 The data is unsorted
 The dataset is small
 Simplicity is more important than performance
 You don’t want to modify or sort the data

---

### 3. Step-by-Step Working

Example array:
`[10, 25, 7, 30, 18]`
Target element: `30`

Steps:

1. Compare `10` with `30` → not equal
2. Compare `25` with `30` → not equal
3. Compare `7` with `30` → not equal
4. Compare `30` with `30` → found

Search stops here.

### 4. Time Complexity Analysis

| Case             | Explanation                                | Time     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Best Case    | Element is at first position               | O(1) |
| Average Case | Element is somewhere in the middle         | O(n) |
| Worst Case   | Element is at last position or not present | O(n) |

---

### 5. Space Complexity

 O(1) (constant space)
 No extra memory required

---

### 6. Advantages

 Very easy to understand and implement
 Works on unsorted data
 No preprocessing required
 Suitable for small datasets

---

### 7. Disadvantages

 Slow for large datasets
 Inefficient compared to Binary Search
 Performance degrades as data size increases

---

### 8. Linear Search vs Binary Search

| Feature          | Linear Search         | Binary Search       |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Data requirement | Unsorted              | Must be sorted      |
| Time complexity  | O(n)                  | O(log n)            |
| Implementation   | Very simple           | More complex        |
| Best use case    | Small / unsorted data | Large / sorted data |

### 9. Real-Life Analogy

Imagine searching for a name in an unsorted attendance list:

 You read each name one by one until you find the correct one
  → that’s Linear Search

---

### 10. When NOT to Use Linear Search

Avoid Linear Search when:

 Data size is very large
 Data is already sorted (use Binary Search instead)
 Performance is critical
