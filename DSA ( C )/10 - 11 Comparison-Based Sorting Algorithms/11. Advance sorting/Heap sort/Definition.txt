### What is Heap Sort?

Heap Sort is an advanced, comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a special data structure called a Binary Heap.

It works by:

 Building a Max Heap (or Min Heap)
 Repeatedly removing the root element
 Placing it at the correct sorted position

Heap Sort combines efficient time complexity with in-place sorting.

### Why Heap Sort is an Advanced Sorting Algorithm

Heap Sort is considered advanced because:

 It relies on a non-trivial data structure (Heap)
 Uses heapify operations
 Guarantees O(n log n) time in all cases
 Requires understanding of tree–array relationships

This makes it conceptually more complex than basic sorting algorithms.

### Core Idea of Heap Sort

1. Convert the array into a Max Heap

    Largest element comes at the root
2. Swap the root with the last element
3. Reduce heap size
4. Heapify the root again
5. Repeat until array is sorted

---

### Binary Heap Basics (Very Important)

 A Binary Heap is a complete binary tree
 Stored using an array
 For index `i`:

   Left child → `2i + 1`
   Right child → `2i + 2`
   Parent → `(i - 1) / 2`

---

### Step-by-Step Example

Array:
`[4, 10, 3, 5, 1]`

Step 1: Build Max Heap

```
        10
       /  \
      5    3
     / \
    4   1
```

Step 2: Swap root with last

```
[1, 5, 3, 4, 10]
```

Step 3: Heapify

```
[5, 4, 3, 1, 10]
```

Repeat until fully sorted →
`[1, 3, 4, 5, 10]`

### Time Complexity Analysis

| Case         | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n log n)  |
| Average Case | O(n log n)  |
| Worst Case   | O(n log n)  |

✅ Heap Sort never degrades to O(n²)

---

### Space Complexity

 O(1) auxiliary space
 Sorting is in-place

This is a major advantage over Merge Sort.

---

### Key Properties of Heap Sort

 ❌ Not stable
 ✅ In-place
 ✅ Predictable performance
 ❌ Not cache-friendly
 ❌ Slower than Quick Sort in practice

---

### Heap Sort vs Quick Sort vs Merge Sort

| Feature    | Heap Sort  | Quick Sort | Merge Sort |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Avg Time   | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) |
| Worst Time | O(n log n) | O(n²)      | O(n log n) |
| Space      | O(1)       | O(log n)   | O(n)       |
| In-place   | ✅          | ✅          | ❌          |
| Stability  | ❌          | ❌          | ✅          |

---

### Where Heap Sort is Used

 Systems requiring guaranteed performance
 Priority queues
 Embedded systems (low memory)
 Security-critical applications

---

### When NOT to Use Heap Sort

 When cache performance matters
 When stability is required
 When average-case speed is critical (Quick Sort is faster)

---

### One-Line Summary

> Heap Sort is a reliable, in-place sorting algorithm with guaranteed O(n log n) performance, but is slower in practice due to poor cache locality.
