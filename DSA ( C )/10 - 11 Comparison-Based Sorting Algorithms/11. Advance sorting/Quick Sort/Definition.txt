### What is Quick Sort?

Quick Sort is an advanced, comparison-based sorting algorithm that also follows the Divide and Conquer strategy.

Unlike Merge Sort, Quick Sort:

 Sorts the array in-place
 Uses a pivot element to partition the array
 Is usually the fastest sorting algorithm in practice

---

### Why Quick Sort is Considered an Advanced Sorting Algorithm

Quick Sort is classified as advanced because:

 It uses divide & conquer
 It involves partitioning logic
 Its performance depends on pivot selection
 It introduces recursion + in-place rearrangement

It is much more efficient than basic sorts for large inputs.

---

### Core Idea of Quick Sort

1. Choose a pivot element
2. Rearrange elements such that:

    Elements smaller than pivot go to the left
    Elements greater than pivot go to the right
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to left and right subarrays

---

### Step-by-Step Working

Given array:
`[10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70]`

1. Choose pivot (commonly last element → `70`)
2. Partition:

    Left side: `[10, 30, 40, 50]`
    Pivot: `70`
    Right side: `[80, 90]`
3. Recursively sort left and right subarrays
4. Final sorted array:
   `[10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 80, 90]`

### Partitioning (Most Important Concept)

Partitioning places the pivot in its correct final position.

Common partition schemes:

 Lomuto partition (simple, more swaps)
 Hoare partition (fewer swaps, slightly complex)

### Time Complexity Analysis

| Case         | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n log n)  |
| Average Case | O(n log n)  |
| Worst Case   | O(n²) ❌     |

⚠️ Worst case occurs when:

 Array is already sorted
 Pivot is always smallest or largest

---

### Space Complexity

 O(log n) (recursive call stack)
 In-place sorting (no extra arrays)

This is a major advantage over Merge Sort.

---

### Key Properties of Quick Sort

 ❌ Not stable
 ✅ In-place
 ✅ Very fast in practice
 ❌ Worst-case O(n²)
 ✅ Cache-friendly
 ✅ Widely used in real systems

---

### Quick Sort vs Merge Sort

| Feature         | Quick Sort | Merge Sort |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Time (Avg)      | O(n log n) | O(n log n) |
| Worst Case      | O(n²)      | O(n log n) |
| Space           | O(log n)   | O(n)       |
| In-place        | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |
| Stability       | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes      |
| Practical Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐        |

---

### Where Quick Sort is Used

 Standard library sorting (with optimizations)
 Competitive programming
 Large in-memory datasets
 Systems where memory efficiency matters

---

### When NOT to Use Quick Sort

 When worst-case performance must be avoided
 When stability is required
 When input is nearly sorted and pivot is poor

---

### One-Line Summary

> Quick Sort is a fast, in-place divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that performs exceptionally well in practice but has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²).
