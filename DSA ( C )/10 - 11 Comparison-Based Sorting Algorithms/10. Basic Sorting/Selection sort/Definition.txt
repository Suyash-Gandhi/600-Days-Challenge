### 1. What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at its correct position.

Unlike Bubble Sort, Selection Sort focuses on finding the correct element first, then doing at most one swap per pass.

### 2. Why is it a Comparison-Based Sort?

 Elements are ordered only by comparing values
 Uses relational comparisons (`<`, `>`)
 No extra data structures or counting logic involved

---

### 3. Core Idea (Very Important)

At any moment, the array is divided into two parts:

1. Sorted part (left side)
2. Unsorted part (right side)

Each pass:

 Find the minimum element in the unsorted part
 Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part
 Increase the size of the sorted part by 1

### 4. How Selection Sort Works (Step-by-Step Concept)

Example array:
`[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`

Pass 1

 Smallest = `11`
 Swap with first element → `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`

Pass 2

 Smallest in remaining array = `12`
 Swap → `[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]`

Pass 3

 Smallest = `22`
 Swap → `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`

Continue until fully sorted.

### 5. Time Complexity Analysis

| Case             | Time Complexity | Reason                              |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n²)       | Always scans the remaining array    |
| Average Case | O(n²)       | Same number of comparisons          |
| Worst Case   | O(n²)       | Reverse order still needs full scan |

👉 Important: Selection Sort does not adapt to already sorted data.

### 6. Space Complexity

 O(1) (In-place)
 Only a constant amount of extra memory is used

---

### 7. Is Selection Sort Stable?

❌ No, Selection Sort is NOT stable

Reason:

 Swapping can change the relative order of equal elements

Example:

```
(5A, 3, 5B) → after sorting → (3, 5B, 5A)
```

---

### 8. Is Selection Sort Adaptive?

❌ No

 Performs the same number of comparisons regardless of input order
 Already sorted array gives no performance improvement

---

### 9. Advantages

 Very simple and intuitive
 Minimal number of swaps
 Works well when swap operations are costly
 In-place algorithm

---

### 10. Disadvantages

 Poor time complexity (O(n²))
 Not stable
 Not adaptive
 Inefficient for large datasets

---

### 11. When Should You Use Selection Sort?

Use Selection Sort when:

 Dataset size is small
 Memory usage must be minimal
 Swap cost is high but comparison cost is low
 Learning and academic purposes

Avoid it when:

 Performance matters
 Large datasets are involved

### 12. Comparison with Other Basic Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm          | Avg Time | Stable | Adaptive      | Swaps       |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| Bubble Sort        | O(n²)    | ✅      | ✅ (optimized) | Many        |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)    | ❌      | ❌             | Minimal |
| Insertion Sort     | O(n²)    | ✅      | ✅             | Few         |

---

### 13. Key Takeaways

 Selection Sort repeatedly selects the minimum element
 Time complexity is always O(n²)
 Uses fewer swaps than Bubble Sort
 Simple but not practical for large inputs
