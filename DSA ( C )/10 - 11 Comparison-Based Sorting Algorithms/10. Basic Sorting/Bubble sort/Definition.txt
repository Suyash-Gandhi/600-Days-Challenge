### 1. What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest comparison-based sorting algorithms.
It works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
With each pass, the largest (or smallest) element “bubbles” to its correct position, hence the name.

### 2. Why is it called a Comparison-Based Sort?

 Decisions are made only by comparing two elements
 Uses relational operators like `>` or `<`
 Does not rely on counting, hashing, or digit positions

---

### 3. How Bubble Sort Works (Conceptual Flow)

1. Start from the first element
2. Compare it with the next element
3. If they are in the wrong order → swap
4. Move one step forward and repeat
5. After one full pass, the largest element is fixed at the end
6. Repeat for the remaining unsorted portion

Each pass reduces the unsorted array size by 1

---

### 4. Example (Conceptual)

Array:
`[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`

 Pass 1 → Largest element `8` moves to the end
 Pass 2 → Next largest settles
 Continue until no swaps are needed

Eventually → `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

### 5. Time Complexity Analysis

| Case             | Time Complexity | Explanation                              |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n)        | Array already sorted (with optimization) |
| Average Case | O(n²)       | Random order                             |
| Worst Case   | O(n²)       | Reverse sorted array                     |

---

### 6. Space Complexity

 O(1) (In-place algorithm)
 No extra memory required

---

### 7. Is Bubble Sort Stable?

✅ Yes, Bubble Sort is stable

 Equal elements retain their relative order
 Important when sorting objects with multiple keys

---

### 8. Is Bubble Sort Adaptive?

 Basic Bubble Sort → ❌ Not adaptive
 Optimized Bubble Sort (using a swap flag) → ✅ Adaptive

   Stops early if no swaps occur in a pass

---

### 9. Advantages

 Very easy to understand
 Simple logic
 Useful for teaching sorting concepts
 Stable and in-place

---

### 10. Disadvantages

 Extremely inefficient for large datasets
 High time complexity
 Rarely used in real-world applications

---

### 11. When Should You Use Bubble Sort?

Use Bubble Sort only when:

 Dataset is very small
 You need a quick educational demonstration
 Code clarity matters more than performance

Avoid it for:

 Large inputs
 Production-level systems
 Performance-critical applications

### 12. Comparison with Other Basic Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Time (Avg) | Stable | In-Place |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n²)      | ✅      | ✅        |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)      | ❌      | ✅        |
| Insertion Sort | O(n²)      | ✅      | ✅        |

### 13. Key Takeaways

 Bubble Sort is a basic comparison-based algorithm
 Best for learning, not for performance
 Easy logic but poor efficiency
 Forms the foundation for understanding better sorting techniques
